<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>In lecturing upon the Antiquity of Man I have found
the minds of the people prepared to receive the evidences,
and ready to believe the conclusions of the geologists. I
have felt the need of a popular work to place in the hands of
the public, that would be both instructive and welcome.
The works of Lyell and Lubbock are too elaborate and too
expensive to meet the popular need. My object has been to
give an outline of the subject sufficient to afford a reasonable
acquaintance with the facts connected with the new science,
to such as desire the information but cannot pursue it
further, and to serve as a manual for those who intend to
become more proficient.</p>

<p>As the Unity of Language and the Unity of the Race are
so closely connected with the subject, I have added the two
chapters on these questions, hoping they will be acceptable
to the reader. It was my intention to have written a more
extended chapter on the relation of the Holy Scriptures to
this subject, but was forced to condense, as I had done in
other chapters, in order not to transcend the proposed limits
of the book.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this work I have freely used Lyell's
"Antiquity of Man" and "Principles of Geology," Lubbock's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
"Pre-Historic Times," Buchner's "Man in the Past,
Present, and Future," Figuier's "Primitive Man," Wilson's
"Pre-Historic Man," Keller's "Lake-Dwellings," the works
of Charles Darwin, Dana's "Manual of Geology," Huxley's
"Man's Place in Nature," Prichard's "Natural History of
Man," Pouchet's "Plurality of the Human Race," and
others, referred to in the margins.</p>

<p>I am indebted to my friend, Mr. Frank Cushing, for the
ideal restoration of the Neanderthal Man. The engraving
was made especially for this work. The references to Buchner
are from his work entitled, "Man in the Past, Present
and Future."</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>


<p>No subject, of late years, has so much engrossed the attention
of geologists as the antiquity of the human race. The
interest was greatly increased by the publication of Sir Charles
Lyell's "Antiquity of Man." This work called the attention
of the public to the subject, and so great became the interest
that many volumes and memoirs have been added to the list,
discussing the question in various ways, and, for the most
part, in such a manner as to add fresh interest and throw
more light on the subject. The scientific men were slow to
take advantage of the discoveries continually being made of
the bones and works of man found in caves and associated
with the remains' of extinct animals. It is probable, even at
this late day, there would not have been so much discussion
of this subject had not Sir Charles Lyell lent the weight of
his great name to it. Educated men, everywhere, began to
doubt the correctness of Archbishop Usher's chronology, and
so complete has been the revolution of opinion that it is
almost impossible to find an intelligent man who would limit
the period of man's existence to 6,000 years.</p>

<p>To Aim&eacute; Bou&eacute;, a French geologist, must be attributed the
honor of having been the first to proclaim the high antiquity
of the human race; to Dr. Schmerling, the learned Belgian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
osteologist, on account of his laborious investigations, untiring
zeal, and great work on the subject, the merited title
of being the founder of the new science; to M. Boucher de
Perthes, its great apostle; while to Sir Charles Lyell and Sir
John Lubbock must be ascribed the honor of having made
the new theory popular.</p>

<p>The new science soon became permanently established,
and the geologists at once set about classifying the facts before
them, in order to assign to them their respective places
in the geological epochs. All are agreed in respect to the
chronological orders, but all have not used the same nomenclature,
in consequence of which more or less confusion has
been the result. Sir J. Lubbock has divided pre-historic
arch&aelig;ology into four great epochs, as follows:</p>

<p>"I. That of the Drift; when man shared the possession
of Europe with the mammoth, the cave-bear, the woolly-haired
rhinoceros, and other extinct animals. This we may
call the 'Pal&aelig;olithic' period.</p>

<p>"II. The later or polished Stone Age; a period characterized
by beautiful stone weapons and instruments made of
flint and other kinds of stone; in which, however, we find no
trace of the knowledge of any metal, excepting gold, which
seems to have been sometimes used for ornaments. This we
may call the 'Neolithic' period.</p>

<p>"III. The Bronze Age, in which bronze was used for
arms and cutting instruments of all kinds.</p>

<p>"IV. The Iron Age, in which that metal had superseded
bronze for arms, axes, knives, etc."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>These divisions are recognized by Lyell and Tylor.</p>

<p>Edward Lartet has proposed the following classification:</p>

<p class="center">I. THE STONE AGE.</p>

<p>1st. Epoch of extinct animals (or of the great bear and
mammoth).</p>

<p>2d. Epoch of migrated existing animals (or the reindeer

<p>3d. Epoch of domesticated existing animals (or the polished
stone epoch).</p>

<p class="center">II. THE METAL AGE.</p>

<p>1st. The Bronze Epoch.</p>

<p>2d. The Iron Epoch.</p>

<p>This mode of division is adopted by M. Figuier, in his
"Primitive Man," by the Museum of Saint-Germain in that
portion devoted to pre-historic antiquities, and adhered to in
essential points by Troyon and d'Archiac.</p>

<p>Professor Renevier, of Lausanne, has proposed a somewhat
different scheme, founded upon the epochs of Swiss
glaciation. It is as follows:</p>

<p>"I. <i>Pre-glacial Epoch</i>, in which man lived cotemporaneously
with the elephant (<i>Elephas antiquus</i>), rhinoceros
(<i>R. hemit&aelig;chus</i>), and the cave-bear (<i>Ursus spel&aelig;us</i>).</p>

<p>"II. <i>Glacial Epoch</i>, in which man lived cotemporaneously
with the mammoth (<i>Elephas primigenius</i>), rhinoceros (<i>R.
tichorrhinus</i>), cave-bear, etc.</p>

<p>"III. <i>Post-glacial Epoch</i>, in which man lived cotemporaneously
with the mammoth and reindeer (<i>Cervus tarandus</i>).</p>

<p>"IV. <i>Last Epoch</i>, or epoch of the <i>Pile-buildings</i>, in
which man lived cotemporaneously with the Irish elk (<i>Megaceros
hibernicus</i>), aurochs (<i>Bison Europ&aelig;us</i>)," etc.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Westropp divides the periods of man, in respect to his
stages of civilization, as follows: <i>Savagery</i>, <i>hunters</i>, <i>herdsmen</i>,
and <i>agriculturists</i>.</p>

<p>In the following pages a somewhat different classification
has been adopted, and may be thus explained:</p>

<p>I. <i>Pre-glacial Epoch</i>; that period antedating the glaciers
of the post-tertiary, in which man lived cotemporaneously
with the animals of the tertiary, southern elephant (<i>E.
meridionalis</i>), etc.</p>

<p>II. <i>Glacial Epoch</i>; that period of the post-tertiary when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
man was forced to contend with the great ice-fields and the
floods immediately succeeding them, when the mammoth
(<i>E. primigenius</i>), rhinoceros (<i>R. tichorrhinus</i>), cave-bear, etc.,
began to flourish.</p>

<p>III. <i>Interglacial Epoch</i>; that period between the glacial
and the second advance of the ice, in which man lived cotemporaneously
with the animals of the preceding epoch,
and the cave bear became extinct.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Reindeer Epoch</i>; that period when the glaciers again
advanced; in which man's chief food consisted of the flesh of
the reindeer (<i>C. tarandus</i>), that animal having made its way
in numerous herds as far south as the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>V. <i>Neolithic Epoch</i>; that period in which man polished
his weapons of stone, and sought to domesticate certain animals,
the dog, etc.</p>

<p>VI. <i>Bronze Epoch</i>; that period characterized by weapons
and implements being made chiefly of bronze.</p>

<p>VII. <i>Iron Epoch</i>; that period in which bronze was generally
superseded by iron.</p>

<p>This classification, on the whole, seems to be the best that
could be devised, for the reason it attempts to place the evidences
of the existence of man in their relative geological
positions.</p>

<p>Other methods have misled the student. There was no
universal Stone, Bronze, or Iron Age. The classification
given by Lubbock applies to Europe, but is too general. I
have adopted the word "Neolithic" for want of a better
term, although the signification of the word is appropriate to
the period it is intended to represent.</p>

<p>These various epochs are not sharply defined, the one
from the other; but one merges into the other by gradual progression
covering a period of thousands of years. The growth
of the various plants and animals, and their retreat or final
extinction, have also been very slow.</p>

<p>An outline of the history of the discoveries which led to a
careful investigation of the question, and which resolved the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
question into a science, is not only one of interest but also of
importance to the careful thinker seeking information on
the subject.</p>

<p>Prior to the study of the ancient implements the "people
had so little notion of the nature and signification of the
stone axes and weapons of earlier and later times that they
were regarded with superstitious fear and hope, and as productions
of lightning and thunder. Hence for a long time they
were called thunderbolts even by the learned.... As
late as the year 1734 when Mahndel explained in the Academy
of Paris that these stones were human implements, he was
laughed at, because he had not proved that they could not
have been formed in the clouds."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>As early as the year 1700, a human skull was dug out of
the calcareous tuff of Constatt, in company with the bones
of the mammoth. It is preserved in the Natural History
Museum at Stuttgart.</p>

<p>In the year 1715, an Englishman named Kemp found in
London, by the side of elephants' teeth, a stone hatchet, similar
to those which have been subsequently found in great
numbers in different parts of the world. This hatchet is still
preserved in the British Museum.</p>

<p>In 1774, in the cavern of Gailenreuth, Bavaria, J. F. Esper
discovered some human bones mingled with the remains
of extinct animals.</p>

<p>In 1797, unpolished flint axes were dug out in great numbers
from a brick-field near Hoxne, county of Suffolk, where
they occurred at a depth of twelve feet, mingled with the
bones of extinct species of animals. They were gathered up
and thrown by basketsful upon the neighboring road. In
the year 1801, before the Society of Antiquaries, John Frere
read a paper upon them, in which he stated that they
pointed to a very remote period. This communication, short
as it was, contained the essence of all subsequent discoveries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
and speculations as to the antiquity of man. But the society
regarded the subject as of no importance.</p>

<p>During the construction of a canal (1815-1823) in Hollerd,
there was found, near Maestricht, in the <i>loess</i>, a human
jaw in company with the bones of extinct animals. This
bone is preserved in the museum at Leyden.</p>

<p>In 1823, Aim&eacute; Bou&eacute; disinterred portions of a human skeleton
from ancient undisturbed loess near Lahr, a small village
nearly opposite Strasbourg. These bones were placed in
the care of Cuvier, but, having been neglected, are now lost.</p>

<p>In the same year, Dr. Buckland, an English geologist, published
his "Reliqui&aelig; Diluvian&aelig;," a work principally devoted
to a description of the Kirkdale Cave. The author combined
all the known facts which favored the coexistence of
man, with the extinct animals.</p>

<p>In 1828, M. Tournal and M. Christol explored numerous
caverns in the south of France. In the cavern of Bize,
Tournal found human bones and teeth, and fragments of rude
pottery, together with the bones of both living and extinct
species of animals, imbedded in the same mud and breccia,
cemented by stalagmite. The human bones were in the same
chemical condition as those of the extinct species.</p>

<p>M. Christol found in the cavern of Pondres, near Nimes,
some human bones in the same mud with the bones of an
extinct hyena and rhinoceros.</p>

<p>In 1833, Dr. Schmerling explored the two bone-caverns
of Engis and Enghihoul (Belgium). In the former he found
the Engis skull (now in the museum of the University of
Li&eacute;ge), at a depth of nearly five feet, under an osseous breccia.
The earth also contained the teeth of rhinoceros, horse, hyena,
and bear, and exhibited no marks of disturbance. He also
found the skull of a young person imbedded by the side of a
mammoth's tooth. It was entire, but so fragile, that it fell
to pieces before it was extracted. In the cave of Enghihoul
he found numerous bones belonging to three human individuals,
mingled with the bones of extinct animals. In these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
caves he noted rude flint instruments, but did not collect
many of them. In the care of Chokier, he discovered a polished
and jointed needle-shaped bone, with a hole pierced
through it, at its base. The caves of Engis and Chokier have
been annihilated, while only a part of Enghihoul remains.</p>

<p>Soon after these discoveries Dr. Schmerling published a
work which described and represented a vast quantity of
objects which had been discovered in the Belgian caverns.
The scientific men were not yet prepared to receive the new
discoveries, and it attracted but little attention at that time.</p>

<p>Too much praise cannot be bestowed upon Dr. Schmerling
for his unremitting labors. Of these labors Sir Charles Lyell
has said: "To have undertaken, in 1832, with a view of
testing its truth (antiquity of fossil human bones) to follow
the Belgian philosopher through every stage of his observations
and proofs, would have been no easy task even for one well-skilled
in geology and osteology. To be let down, as Schmerling
was, day after day, by a rope tied to a tree, so as to slide to
the foot of the first opening of the Engis cave, where the best-preserved
human skulls were found; and, after thus gaining
access to the first subterranean gallery, to creep on all fours
through a contracted passage leading to larger chambers, there
to superintend by torchlight, week after week and year after
year, the workmen who were breaking through the stalagmitic
crust as hard as marble, in order to remove piece by
piece the underlying bone-breccia nearly as hard; to stand
for hours with one's feet in the mud, and with water dripping
from the roof on one's head, in order to mark the position
and guard against the loss of each single bone of a skeleton;
and at length, after finding leisure, strength, and courage for
all these operations, to look forward, as the fruits of one's
labor, to the publication of unwelcome intelligence, opposed
to the prepossessions of the scientific as well as the unscientific
public;&mdash;when these circumstances are taken into account,
we need scarcely wonder.... that a quarter of a
century should have elapsed before even the neighboring pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>fessors
of the University of Li&eacute;ge came forth to vindicate
the truthfulness of their indefatigable and clear-sighted countryman."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In 1835, M. Joly, then professor at the Lyceum of Montpellier,
found in the cave of Nabrigas (Loz&eacute;re) the skull of
a cave-bear, on which an arrow had left its mark. Close
by, was a fragment of pottery marked by the finger of the
moulder.</p>

<p>It was in the valley of the Somme (a river in the north of
France) that M. Boucher de Perthes found those famous flint-axes
of the rudest form. His explorations had been going
on for a long time. He did all he could to bring these discoveries
before the public. In the year 1836 he began to proclaim
the high antiquity of man, in a series of communications
addressed to the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'Emulation of Abbeville. To
the same society, in the year 1838, he exhibited the flint-axes
he had found, but without result. In 1839, he took these
hatchets to Paris, and showed them to some of the members
of the Institute. At first they gave some encouragement
toward these researches; but this favorable feeling did not
last long. In 1841 he began to form his collection, which
has since become so justly celebrated. He engaged trained
workmen to dig in the diluvial beds, and in a short time he
had collected twenty specimens of flint wrought by the hand
of man, though in a very rude state. In 1846, he published
his first work on the subject, entitled "De l'Industrie Primitive,
ou les Arts et leur Origine." In the following year he
published his "Antiquit&eacute;s Celtiques et Ant&eacute;diluviennes," in
which he gave illustrations of these stone implements. This
work attracted no attention until the year 1854, when a
French <i>savant</i>, named Rigollot, made a personal examination
and was successful in his search for these relicts in the neighborhood
of Amiens. He was soon followed by Sir C. Lyell,
Sir John Lubbock, Dr. Falconer, Sir Roderick I. Murchison,
and other eminent scientists.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Boucher de Perthes, continuing his researches, was rewarded,
in the year 1863, by finding the lower half of a
human jaw bone, covered with an earthy crust, which he
extracted with his own hands from a gravel-pit at Abbeville.
A few inches from it a flint hatchet was discovered. They
were at a depth of fifteen feet below the surface. This bone
has been called the jaw of Moulin-Quignon, and is preserved
in the Museum of Natural History at Paris.</p>

<p>The discovery of this bone produced a great sensation
among English geologists. Christy, Falconer, Carpenter,
and Busk went to France and examined the locality where
the bone was found. They went away satisfied with both
its authenticity and antiquity. Some geologists, however,
doubted its authenticity; but at the present time all, or
nearly all, recognize the truth of the conclusions of Boucher
de Perthes.</p>

<p>Not far from the same locality, he was again successful, in
1869, in finding a number of human bones presenting the
same character as the jaw of Moulin-Quignon.</p>

<p>In 1840, Rev. J. MacEnery, of Devonshire, England, found
in a cave, called Kent's Hole, human bones and flint knives
among the remains of the mammoth, cave-bear, hyena,
and two-horned rhinoceros, all from under a crust of stalagmite.
Mr. MacEnery began the explorations of this cave as
early as 1825. He did not publish his notes on his discoveries
but they remained in manuscript until 1859, when they
were obtained by Mr. Vivian.</p>

<p>Mr. Godwin-Austen, in his communication to the Geological
Society in the year 1840, states, in his description of
Kent's Hole, he found works of art in all parts of the cave.</p>

<p>The fossil Man of Denise was discovered by a peasant, in
an old volcanic tuff, near the town of Le Puy-en-Velay,
Central France, an account of which was first published by
Dr. Aymard, in 1844. Able naturalists, who have examined
these bones, especially those familiar with the volcanic regions
of Central France, declared that they believed them to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
been enveloped by natural causes in the tufaceous matrix in
which they are now seen.</p>

<p>In the years 1845-1850, Casiano de Prado made discoveries
on the banks of the Manzanares, near Madrid. They
consisted of portions of the skeletons of the rhinoceros, and a
nearly perfect skeleton of an elephant in the diluvial sand.
Lying beneath this ossiferous sand, were several flint axes of
human workmanship.</p>

<p>Near the town of Aurignac, France, a workman named
Bonnemaison, in the year 1852, accidently discovered a cave
containing the remains of seventeen human skeletons. These
bones were taken by Dr. Amiel, the mayor of Aurignac, who
was ignorant of their value, and consigned to the parish cemetery.
The spot of their re-inhumation has been forgotten,
and this treasure is now lost to science. In 1860, the cave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
was explored by Edward Lartet. After a long and patient
examination, he came to the conclusion that the cave was a
human burial place, cotemporary with the mammoth and other
great animals of the quaternary epoch.</p>

<p>It was at the meeting of the British Association, in 1855,
that Sir Charles Lyell declared his belief in the great antiquity
of the human race. He had before opposed the idea,
but was convinced of the truth by personal examination of
human bones and flint hatchets, from the quarries of St.
Acheul. He became enthusiastic in his investigations, and,
in order to present the discussion clearly to the scientific public,
he published his "Geological Evidences of the Antiquity
of Man," in 1863. In the last edition of his "Principles of
Geology," he bestows considerable space to the discussion of
the subject. He was closely followed, in the same view, by
other eminent geologists.</p>

<p>The remains of the ancient Lake Dwellings of Switzerland
were discovered in the winter of 1853-1854. That winter
was so dry and cold that the water of the lakes fell far below
its ordinary level. On account of this, a large tract of
ground of Lake Zurich was gained by the people throwing
up embankments. In the process of the work, the piles on
which stood the dwellings, fragments of pottery, bone and
stone implements, and various other relics, were discovered.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Dr. Keller, of Zurich, examined the objects, and at once
came to a right understanding as to their signification. He
carefully examined the remains, and described these lake
habitations in six memoirs presented to the Antiquarian
Society of Zurich, in 1854, 1858, 1860, 1863, and 1866. In
1866 these memoirs were translated into English by J. E.
Lee, together with articles from other antiquaries, under the
title of "The Lake Dwellings of Switzerland, and other parts
of Europe." This work contains ninety-seven plates, besides
many wood-cuts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Memoirs of the Dwellers of different lakes have, from time
to time, been published, but they are included in the translated
work of Dr. Keller.</p>

<p>The far-famed Neanderthal skull was discovered by Dr.
Fuhlrott, in the year 1857, in a limestone cavern, near D&uuml;sseldorf,
in a deep ravine known by the name of Neanderthal.
This skull, with parts of the skeleton to which it belonged,
was found under a layer of mud, about five feet in thickness.
It is now in the cabinet of Dr. Fuhlrott, Elberfeld, Rhenish
Prussia.</p>

<p>In 1858, a bone-cavern was found near Torquay, not far
from Kent's Hole. This cave was examined by a scientific
commission. At first it was undertaken by the Royal Society,
but when its grants had failed, Miss Burdett-Coutts paid
the expenses of completing the work. In this cave, under a
layer of stalagmite, were found many flint knives, associated
with the bones of extinct mammals.</p>

<p>M. A. Fontan found in the cave of Massat (Department
of Ari&eacute;ge), in 1859, human teeth and utensils associated with
the remains of the cave-bear, the fossil hyena, and the cave-lion
(<i>Felis spel&#339;a</i>).</p>

<p>In 1861, M. A. Milne Edwards found certain relics of
human industry mingled with the fossil bones of animals, in
the cave of Lourdes, France.</p>

<p>In 1862, Dr. Garrigou published the result of the researches
which he, in conjunction with Rames and Filhol, had
made in the caverns of Ari&eacute;ge. These explorers found the
jaw-bones of the cave-bear and cave-lion, which had been
wrought by the hands of man.</p>

<p>In the upper strata of the tertiary beds (pliocene) at St.
Prest (Department of Eure), in the year 1863, M. Desnoyers
found the bones of extinct animals which were cut or notched
by flint instruments. In the same strata Abb&eacute; Bourgeois discovered
implements of stone. He communicated his discoveries
to the International Congress held at Paris in 1867.</p>

<p>In 1864, James Brown found flint implements midway<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
between Gosport and Southampton, included in gravel from
eight to twelve feet thick, capping a cliff which at its
greatest height is thirty-five feet above high-water mark.
These flint tools exactly resemble those found at Abbeville
and Amiens. Some of them are preserved in the Blackmore
Museum at Salisbury.</p>

<p>In 1865, there was found in the loess of the Rhine, near
Colmar, Alsace, human bones in the same bed with bones of
the mammoth, horse, stag, auroch, and other animals.</p>

<p>In 1866, Alfred Stevens first dug out a hatchet from the
gravel at the top of the sea-cliff east of the Bournemouth
opening, Southampton river. Soon after, Dr. Blackmore, to
the west of the valley, obtained two other flint implements.
The spot was examined by Lyell in 1867.</p>

<p>Dr. Edward Dupont, an eminent Belgian cave explorer,
in the year 1866, found a fragment of a human jaw in the
Trou de la Naulette, a bone cave situated on the bank of the
river Lesse not far from Chaleux.</p>

<p>At the International Congress of 1867, M. A. Issel reported
he had found several human bones in beds of Pliocene age,
near Savonia, in Liguria.</p>

<p>The Reindeer Station on the Schusse, in Swabia, was discovered
in 1867, during the operations undertaken for the
improvement of a mill-pond. The Schusse is a little river
which flows into the lake of Constance, and its source is upon
the high plateau of Upper Swabia between the lake of Constance
and the upper course of the Danube.</p>

<p>In 1868, Thomas Codrington discovered an oval flint implement
in gravel at the top of the Foreland Cliff, Isle of
Wight, five miles southeast of Ryde.</p>

<p>The fossil Man of Mentone was discovered, in 1873, by M.
Rivi&eacute;re, in a cave near Nice, France. The skeleton was
almost entire, and imbedded twenty feet below the surface of
the deposit.</p>

<p>In 1873, M. Rivi&eacute;re discovered another human skeleton,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
by the side of which lay a few unpolished stone implements,
in one of the caves in the same neighborhood.</p>

<p>In 1873 and 1874, M. Rivi&eacute;re was again so fortunate as to
discover, in neighboring caves, the remains of three persons,
two of them those of children. The skeletons were in the
same condition, and decked with similar ornaments, as those
he had previously discovered.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>GLACIAL EPOCH.</h3>


<p>Happily for the Arch&aelig;o-geologist, there is given him a
point from which to start in his researches into the antiquity
of his race. Without it his calculations would be very indefinite
and his efforts would be shorn of much of their interest.
The Glacial Epoch, that has puzzled the mind of both the
geologist and the astronomer, is a guide-post where he may
not only look both ways, but also estimate the length of ages
and number the years of man. Nothing, then, is of more
importance, in this investigation, than an understanding of
the condition of the earth prior to the glacial, and the knowledge
of the date and length of this epoch.</p>

<p>For untold ages the earth, to all appearance, had been
preparing itself for the reception of man. There was an
abundance of game, the forests were beautiful, the domestic
animals had made their appearance, the climate was warm,
the soil rich, and the coal had been formed. Everything
seemed to point to a bright and glorious future for man, who
had already entered upon the scene. It is true there were
fierce and savage beasts to contend with. These seemed but
a motive power to stir man to action and develop the resources
of his mind. Should he fail for a time to overcome the wild
beasts a retreat was provided in the hollow recesses of the
earth. But nature felt her work was still unfinished. The
earth had passed through the ordeal of fire, and withstood the
devastations of water, and now her long summer must come
to an end. The arctic regions had been growing colder and
colder, and the change was felt in the countries to the south.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
The northern animals were being clothed with a hairy or
woolly garment for their protection. The aspect began to be
forbidding. The future prospect of man was not only gloomy,
but foreboded he should perish along with the many species
of animals that were gradually succumbing to the cold.
Great fields of ice were slowly accumulating at both the poles,
and at last, by the power of their great weight, assisted by
some geographical changes, began to move toward the equator,
crushing and grinding the great rocks, and either driving
before them, or else destroying, every living thing in their
relentless march. Slowly but surely they moved on. The
mountains groaned under the enormous weight of ice. Their
heads were scarred, their sides bruised, torn and cut. The
icy monsters listened not to the pleadings of earth, the lowing
of cattle, or the cries of man. Centuries elapsed before the
sun re-asserted his power. The rays of the sun, the internal
heat of the earth, and other causes, produced a change. The
northern ice was broken up by the time it reached latitude
39&deg; North America, leaving its indelible traces in the bowlders,
gravel, beds of sand and clay which mark its course.
In Europe this sheet of ice extended as far south as Spain
and Corsica. The glaciers of the Antarctic regions extended
as far as latitude 41&deg; south.</p>

<p><i>Fauna of Europe.</i>&mdash;Among the Fauna may be mentioned
the gigantic elephants, of nearly twice the bulk of the largest
individuals that now exist, which roamed in herds over
England, and extended across the Siberian plains and from
Behring Strait to South Carolina. Two-horned rhinoceroses
wallowed in the swamps of the ancient forests. Hippopotamuses
inhabited the lakes and rivers. The great cave-bear,
which sometimes attained the size of a horse, and the cave-tiger,
twice as large as the living tiger, preyed upon the animals
of less strength than themselves. Troops of hyenas,
larger than those of South America, disputed with other beasts
of prey. A species of wild-cat, lynx, and leopard found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
retreats in the same forests. Then there was a remarkable
carnivorous animal called <i>Machairodus</i>, about the size of a
tiger, and from the shape and size of the sword-like teeth,
must have been a very destructive creature. The lemming
and the musk ox found a home, and the wild horse pranced
about unrestrained by the hand of man. The great Irish elks
swiftly moved over the ground, and must have been very
numerous, as their remains occur in abundance in peat-bogs
and marl-pits. Nor should it be unmentioned that there
was also a species of gigantic ox nearly as large as an elephant,
that subsisted on the plains. All these animals followed the
retreat of the glaciers and some of them were in close proximity
to the ice.</p>

<p><i>Geological Period.</i>&mdash;The glacial epoch occurred during
the geological period known as the post-tertiary. The tertiary
had gradually passed away and its time had been recorded on
the pages of geological history. A new epoch began to dawn.
This was the epoch of ice, the birth and almost the childhood
of the post-tertiary.</p>

<p><i>Probable Date.</i>&mdash;In discussing the probable date of the
glacial epoch, Sir Charles Lyell says, "The attempt to assign
a chronological value to any of our geological periods except
the latest, must, in the present state of science, be hopeless.
Nevertheless, independently of all astronomical considerations,
it must, I think, be conceded that the period required
for the coming on of the greatest cold, and for its duration
when most intense, and the oscillations to which it was subject,
as well as the retreat of the glaciers and the 'great thaw'
or disappearance of snow from many mountain-chains where
the snow was once perpetual, required not tens but hundreds
of thousands of years. Less time would not suffice for the
changes in physical geography and organic life of which we
have evidence. To a geologist, therefore, it would not appear
startling that the greatest cold should be supposed to have
been two hundred thousand years ago, although this date<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
must be considered as very conjectural, and one which may
be as likely to err in deficiency of time as in excess."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Sir John Lubbock, in his dissent from some calculations
made by Mr. Geikie on the general effect produced by rivers
in excavating valleys and lowering the general level of the
country, says, "As regards the higher districts, however, his
data are perhaps not far wrong, and if we apply them to the
valley of the Somme, where the excavation is about two hundred
feet in depth, they would indicate an antiquity for the
pal&aelig;olithic epoch of from one hundred thousand to two hundred
and forty thousand years."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Dana, in his chapter on the length of geological time, says,
in speaking of the time required to excavate the gorge of
Niagara River, that "on both sides of the gorge near the
whirlpool, and also at Goat Island, there are beds of recent
lake shells ... the same kinds that live in still
water near the entrance to the lake, and which are not found
in the rapids. The lake, therefore, spread its still waters,
when these beds were formed, over the gorge above the whirlpool.
A tooth of a mastodon (<i>M. giganteus</i>) has been found
in the same beds. This locates the time in the Champlain
epoch.... Six miles of the gorge have been excavated
since that mastodon was alive....</p>

<p>"There is a lateral valley leading from the whirlpool
through the Queenstown precipice at a point a few miles west of
Lewiston. This valley is filled with drift of the glacial epoch,
and this blocking up of the channel may have compelled it to
open a new passage.</p>

<p>"If, then, the falls have been receding six miles, and we
can ascertain the probable rate of progress, we may approximate
to the length of time it required. Hall and Lyell estimated
the average rate at one foot a year,&mdash;which is certainly
large. Mr. Desor concluded, after his study of the falls, that
it was 'more nearly three feet a century than three feet a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
year.' Taking the rate at one foot a year, the six miles will
have required over thirty-one thousand years; if at one inch
a year&mdash;which is eight and one third feet a century&mdash;three
hundred and eighty thousand years."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The calculation made by Dana is for the Champlain epoch.
As this epoch was subsequent to the glacial, the time must be
either thrown still farther back, or else allow the calculations
to begin with the end of the glacial.</p>

<p><i>Probable Duration.</i>&mdash;Lyell has attempted to form an
estimate of the duration of the glacial epoch by considering
"the most simple series of changes in physical geography
which can possibly account for the phenomena of the glacial
period," and enumerates as follows:</p>

<p>"First, a continental period, toward the close of which
the forest of Cromer flourished; when the land was at least
five hundred feet above its present level, perhaps much higher,
and its extent probably greater than that given in the map,
Fig. 41." (In this map the whole of the British Isles are connected
with one another, and with the continent&mdash;the German
Ocean and the English Channel constituting dry land).</p>

<p>"Secondly, a period of submergence, by which the land
north of the Thames and Bristol Channel, and that of Ireland,
was gradually reduced to an archipelago; and finally to
such a general prevalence of sea as is seen in map, Fig. 39."
(This map is intended to represent the British Isles as
they appeared above water when Scotland was submerged
to two thousand feet and other parts of the isles to one
thousand three hundred feet.) "This was the period of
submergence and of floating ice, when the Scandinavian flora,
which occupied the lower grounds during the first continental
period, may have obtained exclusive possession of the only
lands not covered with perpetual snow.</p>

<p>"Thirdly, a second continental period, when the bed of the
glacial sea, with its marine shells and erratic blocks, was laid
dry, and when the quantity of land equalled that of the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
period.... During this period there were glaciers
in the higher mountains of Scotland and Wales....</p>

<p>"The submergence of Wales to the extent of one thousand
four hundred feet, as proved by glacial shells, would require
fifty-six thousand years, at the rate of two and a half feet per
century; but taking Professor Ramsay's estimate of eight
hundred feet more, that depression being required for the
deposition of some of the stratified drift, we must demand
an additional period of thirty-two thousand years, amounting
in all to eighty-eight thousand; and the same time
would be required for the re&euml;levation of the tract to its
present height. But if the land rose in the second continental
period no more than six hundred above the present level ...
this ... would have taken another twenty-six thousand
years; the whole of the grand oscillation, comprising the
submergence and re&euml;mergence, having taken, in round numbers,
two hundred and twenty-four thousand years for its
completion; and this, even if there were no pause or stationary
period, when the downward movement ceased, and before
it was converted into an upward one."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Lyell admits that the average rate of two and a half feet
per century is a purely arbitrary and conjectural one, and
there are cases where the change is even six feet a century,
yet the average rate of motion, he thinks, will not exceed
that above proposed. With this opinion, Lubbock believes
most geologists will agree.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>By the estimates already given a basis is formed upon
which a calculation can be made as to the time when this
epoch began. At the time of the most intense cold the
eccentricity of the earth's orbit was .0575; the difference in
millions of miles between the greatest and least distances of
the earth from the sun 10&frac12;; the number of days by which
winter, occurring in aphelion was longer than the summer in
perihelion 27.8; the mean temperature of the hottest sum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>mer
month in the latitude of London when the summer
occurs in perihelion, 113&deg;; the mean temperature of the
coldest winter month in the latitude of London when the
winter occurs in aphelion, 0&deg; 7'. Sixty thousand years later the
eccentricity of the earth's orbit was but .0332; the difference
of distance in millions of miles was 6; number of winter days
in excess, 16.1; mean of hottest month in latitude of London,
95&deg;, and mean of coldest month 12&deg;. It is evident then at
this time (one hundred and fifty thousand years ago) a
"great thaw" had taken place and the glaciers driven back,
although fifty thousand years later less intense cold set in
again. If thirty thousand years be allowed for the "great
thaw" from the extreme point of cold, and that extreme
point to have been two hundred and ten thousand years ago,
then one hundred and eighty thousand years ago the glaciers
had become so broken up as to allow vegetation to spring up
in many localities, and the wild beasts to partially reassert
their dominion. If to this be added the time required for the
duration of the glacial epoch (two hundred and twenty-four
thousand years) then the time when the ice began to accumulate
was four hundred and four thousand years ago. But if
the tables of Mr. Croll be correct, their beginning could not
have been earlier than three hundred and fifty thousand
years ago, as the eccentricity of the earth's orbit varied but
little from the present, and five hundred and fifty thousand
years ago it was almost identical with that of the present.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>During the last stages of this ocean of ice it must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
melted very rapidly,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> for great rivers were formed, and the
water pouring down its icy bed sought other streams, and on
the bosom of the earth swept away loose sediment, depositing
it along the course of rivers and in caves of the earth, covering
the remains of man along with those of animals that
perished during the long winter of ice.</p>

<p><i>Evidences of the Existence of Man.</i>&mdash;The traces of man in
the deposits made during the glacial epoch are numerous.
Out of the many, the most noted will be given, with a view
to their chronological order.</p>

<p>In all probability the very oldest implements of the post-tertiary,
and consequently the beginning of the glacial epoch,
if not of the pliocene, are those found in the south of Hampshire,
between Gosport and Southampton. They came from
a tabular mass of drift which caps the tertiary strata. "The
great bed of gravel resting on eocene tertiary strata, in which
these implements have been found, consists in most places of
half-rolled or semi-angular chalk flints, mixed with rounded
pebbles washed out of the tertiary strata.... Many of
them exhibit the same colors and ochreous stain as do the
flints in the gravel in which they lay."</p>

<p>West of the Southampton estuary, "on both sides of the
opening at Bournemouth, flint tools of the ancient type have
been met with in the gravel capping the cliffs. The gravel
from which the flint tool was taken at Bournemouth is about
one hundred feet above the level of the sea.... The
gravel consists in great part of pebbles derived from tertiary
strata."</p>

<p>The oval flint implement discovered in gravel at the top
of the Foreland cliff "is of the true pal&aelig;olithic type, and the
gravel in which it is imbedded at the height of about eighty
feet above the level of the sea, may have once extended to the
cliffs near Gosport; in which case we should have to infer that
the channel called the Solent had not yet been scooped out
when this region was inhabited by pal&aelig;olithic man."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>It may be safely inferred that the implements in the
above three enumerations were imbedded at about the same
time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>The flint implements from the valley of the Somme,
which have been of so much interest, and convinced so many
sceptical geologists, belong to the early part of this epoch.
This valley may be represented by Fig. 3.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 1024px;">

<p>1. Peat, twenty to thirty feet thick, resting on gravel, <i>a</i>.<br />
2. Lower level gravel, with elephants' bones and flint tools covered with fluviatile
loam, twenty to forty feet thick.<br />
3. Upper level gravel, with similar fossils, and overlying loam. In all thirty feet
thick.<br />
4. Upland loam without shells, five or six feet thick.<br />
5. Eocene tertiary strata, resting on the chalk in patches.</p>
</div>

<p>In explanation of the above it may be well to remark that
No. 2 indicates the lower level gravels, and No. 3 the higher
ones, which are from eighty to one hundred feet above the
river. Of a later date than these is the peat, No. 1, which
is from ten to thirty feet in thickness. Underneath the
peat is a bed of gravel, <i>a</i>, from three to fourteen feet thick,
resting on undisturbed chalk. But between the gravel and
the peat is a thin layer of impervious clay. This section of
the valley of the Somme is a pretty fair representation of the
arrangements of the different beds at Abbeville, Amiens, and
and St. Acheul.</p>

<p>In these beds are the records of two drift periods, marked
by 2 and 3. The two are separated by a layer of fresh-water
deposits, which contains river shells and is sometimes
as much as sixteen feet thick. The lower, or gray diluvium,
(No. 2), marks the glacial epoch, as distinct from the glaciers
of the reindeer epoch. In the lower gravel, lying immediately
upon the tertiary formation, were found the flint
hatchets, together with the bones of the mammoth and fossil
rhinoceros.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to understand the deposits still more clearly, the
following figure is given.</p>

</div>


<p>At St. Acheul, in bed No. 4, were found large numbers of
flint implements. Some of them have the shape of a spear-head,
and are over seven inches in length. The oval-shaped
hatchets are so rude in some instances as to require a practised
eye to decide their human origin. In the same bed are
found small round bodies having a tubular cavity in the
centre. Dr. Rigollot has suggested that these perforated
stones or gravel were used as ornaments, possibly strung
together as beads.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>In this bed, No. 4, seventeen feet from the surface, was
found a mammoth's tooth. About one foot below the tooth,
in densely compressed gravel, was found a stone hatchet of an
oval form.</p>

<p>"These spear-headed implements have been found in greater number, proportionally
to the oval ones, in the upper level gravel at St. Acheul, than in any of the
lower gravels in the valley of the Somme. In these last, the oval form predominates,
especially at Abbeville."&mdash;<i>Antiquity of Man</i>, p. 114.</p>
</div>

<p>That this bed was formed by action of glaciers is shown,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
not only from the well-rounded tertiary pebbles, but also
from the great blocks of hard sandstone, some of which are
over four feet in diameter. These large fragments not only
abound at St. Acheul in both the higher and lower level
gravels at Amiens, and at the higher level at Abbeville, but
they are also traced far up the valley wherever the old diluvium
occurs. All of these sandstones have been derived
from the tertiary strata which once covered the chalk.</p>

</div>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>As the flint implements of Abbeville and Amiens are the
same as those of St. Acheul, and from the same beds, what
has already been said will apply to them. These implements
have been found in these localities in great numbers, as several
thousand of them already taken from the beds will
amply testify.</p>

<p>From the gravel-pit in which were found the flint axes,
at Abbeville, and close to the ancient chalk, was taken the
celebrated human bone known as the <i>jaw</i> of Moulin-Quignon.
It was cotemporary with the axes, and undoubtedly some of
the flint implements there found were fashioned by the man
of whom that jaw formed so necessary a part.</p>

<p>This jaw-bone belonged to an old man, and is described as
displaying "a tendency toward the animal structure in the
shortness and breadth of the ascending ramus (the perpendicular
portion of the lower jaw), the equal height of the two
apophyses (a process or regular prominence forming a continuous
part of the body of the bone), the indication of
prognathism (projecting jaw) furnished by the very obtuse
angle at which the ramus joins the body of the bone.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Near the same locality other human bones were discovered
Which presented the same characteristics.</p>

<p>Boucher de Perthes having pointed out that flint implements
could be found in the valley of the Seine, in beds
similar to those of Abbeville, the antiquaries were soon
rewarded and Boucher de Perthes' prediction was fulfilled.
M. Gosse, of Geneva, found the Abbeville type of implements
in the lowest diluvial deposits associated with the remains of
animals of that period.</p>

<p>The discovery made by Casiano de Prado, near Madrid, is
very similar to those of Abbeville. "First, vegetable soil;
then about twenty-five feet of sand and pebbles, under which
was a layer of sandy loam, in which, during the year 1850, a
complete skeleton of the mammoth was discovered. Under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>neath
this stratum was about ten feet of coarse gravel, in
which some flint axes, very closely resembling those of
Amiens, have been discovered."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The remains of man are also preserved in caverns associated
with the fossil bones of the mammoth, the woolly-haired
rhinoceros, cave-bear, and other extinct quadrupeds. Among
these should be noticed Kent's Hole, which has furnished a
mine of wealth. Of his discoveries Godwin-Austen says:
"Human remains and works of art, such as arrow-heads and
knives of flint, occur in all parts of the cave, and throughout
the entire thickness of the clay; and no distinction founded
on condition, distribution, or relative position can be observed,
whereby the human can be separated from the other
reliqui&aelig;," which included bones of the mammoth (<i>E. primigenius</i>),
rhinoceros (<i>R. tichorrhinus</i>), cave-bear (<i>Ursus spel&aelig;us</i>),
cave-hyena (<i>H. spel&aelig;us</i>), and other mammalia. These
researches were conducted in parts of the cave which had
never been disturbed, and the works of man, in every instance,
were procured from undisturbed loam or clay, beneath a thick
covering of stalagmite; and all these must have been introduced
before the stalagmite flooring had been formed.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
These specimens of man's handicraft were found far below
the stalagmite floor.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Closely allied to Kent's Hole is Brixham
Cave. The following gives the general succession of
deposits forming the contents of the cavern:</p>

<p>1. A layer of stalagmite varying from one to fifteen inches
in thickness.</p>

<p>2. Next below, ochreous cave-earth, from one foot to
fifteen feet in thickness.</p>

<p>3. Rounded gravel, in some places more than twenty feet
in depth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>In the second layer there were found the remains of the
mammoth, rhinoceros, cave-bear, cave-hyena, cave-lion, reindeer,
and seven other species. Indiscriminately mixed with
these bones were found many flint knives, but chiefly from
the lowest part of the ochreous cave-earth, varying in depth
from ten inches to thirteen feet. The antiquity of these cannot
be doubted, from the simple fact, even if there was no
other, that in close proximity to a very perfect flint tool was
discovered the entire left hind leg of a cave-bear, and every
bone in its natural position. From the bone earth there were
taken fifteen knives, recognized, by the experienced antiquaries,
as having been artificially formed. In the lowest gravel,
underlying all, there were found imperfect specimens of flint
knives. The fine layer of mud was deposited by the slow but
regular action of water. Since these layers were formed the
stream has cut its channel seventy-eight feet below its
former level.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>On both banks of the Meuse, at Maestricht (Hollerd) are
terraces of gravel covered with loess. Below the city, on
the left bank, one of these terraces projects into the alluvial
plain of the Meuse. During the construction of the
canal the terrace was opened to a depth of sixty feet. The
upper twenty feet consisted of loess and the lower forty
feet of stratified gravel. Great numbers of molars, tusks,
and bones of elephants, together with those of other mammalia,
and a human lower jaw with teeth, were found in or near
this gravel. The human jaw was at a depth of nineteen feet
from the surface, in a stratum of sandy loam, beneath a
stratum of pebbly and sandy beds, and immediately above the
gravel. The stratum from which the jaw was taken was
intact and had never been disturbed. But the jaw was somewhat
isolated, and the nearest fossil object was the tusk of an
elephant six yards distant, though on a horizontal plane.
This fossil is probably older than that discovered at Lahr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
It was probably covered just before the gush of the water
when it first began to flow from the gorges and had washed
the ground at some distance from the ice.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The human skeleton from the undisturbed loess of the
Rhine, near Lahr, was found in nearly a horizontal position,
but in such a manner as to forbid the idea of sepulchre.
These bones were exhumed from a perpendicular cliff of
solid loess, about five feet high. The town of Lahr is situated
four miles from, and about one hundred feet above, the
Rhine, and not far from the tributary valley drained by the
Schutter, flowing from the Black Forest.</p>

<p>In the alluvial plain into which the Schutter flows the
the loess is two hundred feet thick. The loess rises eighty
feet above the Schutter. At Lahr it has been denuded so as
to form a succession of terraces on the right bank. It was in
the lowest of these from which the skeleton was taken. Immediately
below this bed there were found pebbles, and still
lower down was a bed of gravel containing rounded stones of
sandstone and gneiss from the Black Forest.</p>

<p>There are several interesting facts connected with this
discovery. M. Bou&eacute; considers that the loess of the Lahr is
continuous with that of the Rhine, and before the loess had
been denuded there was not less than eighty feet of loamy deposit
above the human skeleton. The glaciers had deposited
their great gravel beds, and had began to melt. The melting
of them had formed a mixture of loam and gravel. Then
when the torrents poured forth from the glaciers the loam was
formed without the pebbles. The unfortunate man, whose
remains were found, was buried far beneath the surface, during
the very first part of the course of the violent streams
pouring forth from the field of ice. The glaciers were then
on the retreat, and the incautious man probably fell a victim
while on the chase.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>The cave of La Naulette, Belgium, afforded a jaw-bone
similar to the Moulin-Quignon. The bone came from a
river deposit of loam covered with a layer of stalagmite, and
at a depth of thirteen feet from the surface. Associated with
it were the remains of the mammoth, woolly-haired rhinoceros,
and flint implements. These implements present the same
type as those of St. Acheul. With this jaw were also found a
human ulna, two human teeth, and a fragment of a worked
reindeer born. This jaw-bone is very thick, round in form,
and the projection of the chin is almost entirely absent. The
chin is said to hold an intermediate position between that of
the animals and those of the present race of men. The cavities
for the reception of the canine teeth are very wide, and one
of the most remarkable things is that the three molars are
reversed, that is the first true molar is the smallest, and the
last the largest. The inner surface of the jaw at the point of
the suture or symphysis, forms a line obliquely directed upwards.
Taking the jaw all in all, it is the most ape-like
human jaw ever discovered.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The flint implements from Hoxne were found under three
different layers or beds. The first, vegetable, a foot and a
half in depth. The second was clay, seven and a half feet
thick. The third, a bed of sand, with shells one foot in thickness.
The fourth layer, containing the implements was a bed
of gravel two feet in depth. The number of these flints was
so great that they were carried out by the baskets-full, and
thrown into the ruts of the adjoining road. On account
of the great number, this spot might have been the place
where they were manufactured. Their date is not coeval
with the bowlder clay, but undoubtedly belong, to the last
of this epoch.</p>

<p>The human bones found in the loess of the Rhine, near
Colmar, were two fossilized fragments of the skull. They
were found in undisturbed soil along with the fossil bones of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
the extinct species of mammoth, horse, gigantic deer, aurochs,
and other mammalia. The fragment of the skull "showed a
depressed forehead, strongly projecting superciliary arches,
and a type, on the whole, approaching the so-called <i>dolichocephalic</i>,
or long-headed form."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> These remains date so near
the end of the glacial as to almost enter the inter-glacial.</p>

<h3>GLACIAL EPOCH&mdash;CONTINUED.</h3>


<p><i>Belgian Caverns.</i>&mdash;The relics discovered by Dr. Schmerling,
in the caves of Belgium, must be referred to the time
of the retreat of the glaciers. The glaciers were still in
existence, but their receding had freed immense tracts of land,
and the space they now covered was small in proportion to
their former extent. Whether it be considered or not, that
vegetation greatly nourished and the great wild beasts were
rapidly increasing, one thing must be noticed, and that is,
floods must have succeeded or followed closely upon the
retreat of the ice. Many remains, referred to the glacial epoch,
may in reality, have occupied the time of the floods occurring
just previous to the commencement of the inter-glacial.</p>

<p>The Belgian Caverns, near Li&eacute;ge, either belong exactly to
the ice, or else to a period not far removed. Lyell considers
the older monuments of the pal&aelig;olithic period to be the rude
implements found in ancient river gravel and in the mud and
stalagmite caves.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Caves of this description are those reported
on by Dr. Schmerling.</p>

<p>The caverns of the province of Li&eacute;ge were not the dens
of wild beasts, but their contents had been swept in by the
action of water. The bones of man "were of the same color,
and in the same condition as to the amount of animal matter
contained in them, as those of the accompanying animals,
some of which, like the cave-bear, hyena, elephant, and rhinoceros,
were extinct; others, like the wild-cat, beaver, wild
boar, roe-deer, wolf, and hedgehog, still extant. The fossils<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
were lighter than fresh bones, except such as had their pores
filled with carbonate of lime, in which case they were often
much heavier. The human remains of most frequent occurrence
were teeth detached from the jaw, and the carpal,
metacarpal, tarsal, metatarsal, and phalangial bones separated
from the rest of the skeleton. The corresponding
bones of the cave-bear, the most abundant of the accompanying
mammalia, were also found in the Li&eacute;ge caverns more
commonly than any others, and in the same scattered condition."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
In some of these caves, rude flint implements, of a
triangular form, were found dispersed through the cave mud.
Dr. Schmerling did not pay much attention to these, as he
was engrossed in his osteological inquiries. The human
bones were met with at all depths, in the cave mud and
gravel, both above and below those of the extinct mammalia.</p>

<p>The floors of these caverns were incrusted with stalagmite.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
In the cavern at Chokier there occur "three distinct
beds of stalagmite, and between each of them a mass of
breccia, and mud mixed with quartz pebbles, and in the
three deposits the bones of extinct quadrupeds."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>


<p class="center">FOSSIL SKULL OF THE ENGIS CAVE NEAR LIEGE.</p>

<p>The fossil skull from the cavern of Engis was deposited
at a depth of about five feet, under an osseous breccia containing
a tusk of the rhinoceros, the teeth of the horse, and the
remains of small animals. The breccia was about three and
one-fourth feet wide, and rose to the height of about five feet
above the floor of the cavern. In the earth which contained
the skull there was found, surrounding it on all sides, the
teeth of the rhinoceros, horse, hyena, and bear, and with no
marks of the earth having been disturbed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>There was also found the cranium of a young person, in
the floor of the cavern, besides an elephant's tooth. When
first observed, the skull was entire, but fell to pieces when
removed from its position. Besides these there were found a
fragment of a superior maxillary bone, with the molar teeth
worn down to the roots, indicating that of an old man; two
vertebr&aelig;, a first and last dorsal; a clavicle of the left side,
belonging to a young individual of great stature; two fragments
of the radius, indicating a man of ordinary height; a
fragment of an ulna: some metacarpal bones; six metatarsal,
three phalanges of the hand and one of the foot.</p>

<p>Dr. Schmerling found in this cave a pointed bone implement
incrusted with stalagmite and joined to a stone.</p>

<p>Of the Engis skull Professor Huxley has remarked, "As
Professor Schmerling observes, the base of the skull is destroyed,
and the facial bones are entirely absent; but the roof
of the cranium, consisting of the frontal, parietal, and the
greater part of the occipital bones, as far as the middle of the
occipital foramen, is entire, or nearly so. The left temporal
bone is wanting. Of the right temporal, the parts in the
immediate neighborhood of the auditory foramen, the mastoid
process, and a considerable portion of the squamous
element of the temporal, are well preserved."</p>

<p>A piece of the occipital bone, which Schmerling seems to
have missed, has since been fitted on to the rest of the cranium
by Dr. Spring, the accomplished anatomist of Li&eacute;ge.</p>

<p>"The skull is that of an adult, if not middle-aged man.
The extreme length of the skull is 7.7 inches. Its extreme
breadth, which corresponds very nearly with the interval
between the parietal protuberances, is not more than 5.4
inches. The proportion of the length to the breadth is therefore
very nearly as 100 to 70. If a line be drawn from the
point at which the brow curves in towards the root of the
nose, and which is called the 'glabella' (<i>a</i>, Fig. 8), to the
occipital protuberance (<i>d</i>), and the distance to the highest
point of the arch of the skull be measured perpendicularly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
from this line, it will be found to be 4.75 inches. Viewed
from above, the forehead presents an evenly rounded curve,
and passes into the contour of the sides and back of the skull,
which describes a tolerably regular elliptical curve.</p>

<p>"The front view shows that the roof of the skull was very
regularly and elegantly arched in the transverse direction,
and that the transverse diameter was a little less below the
parietal protuberances, than above them. The forehead
cannot be called narrow in relation to the rest of the skull,
nor can it be called a retreating forehead; on the contrary,
the antero-posterior contour of the skull is well arched, so
that the distance along that contour, from the nasal depres<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>sion
to the occipital protuberance, measures about 13.75
inches. The transverse arc of the skull, measured from one
auditory foramen to the other, across the middle of the
sagittal suture, is about 13 inches. The sagittal suture itself
is 5.5 inches long. The superciliary prominences or brow-ridges
(<i>a</i>) are well, but not excessively, developed, and are
separated by a median depression. Their principal elevation
is disposed so obliquely that I judge them to be due to large
frontal sinuses. If a line joining the glabella and the occipital
protuberance (<i>a</i>, <i>d</i>, Fig. 8) be made horizontal, no part
of the occipital region projects more than one-tenth of an
inch behind the posterior extremity of that line, and the upper
edge of the auditory foramen is almost in contact with a line
drawn parallel with this upon the outer surface of the skull."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Some of the views expressed by Professor Huxley are at
variance with those of other eminent scientists. Lubbock
reports him as saying, "There is no mark of degradation
about any part of its structure. It is, in fact, a fair average
human skull, which might have belonged to a philosopher, or
might have contained the thoughtless brains of a savage."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Mr. Busk agrees and partially disagrees with Professor
Huxley, for he remarked to Lyell, "Although the forehead
was somewhat narrow, it might nevertheless be matched by
the skulls of individuals of European race."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Schmerling, Buchner, and Vogt are arrayed against
Huxley. The first says, "I hold it to be demonstrated that
this cranium has belonged to a person of limited intellectual
faculties, and we conclude thence that it belonged to a man
of a low degree of civilization."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> "From the narrowness of
the frontal portion it belonged to an individual of small intellectual
development."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Buchner says, "In its length and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
narrowness, the slight elevation of its forehead, the form of
the widely separated orbits and the well developed supra-orbital
arches, it resembles, especially when viewed from
above, the celebrated Neanderthal skull, but in general is far
superior to this in its structure."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Carl Vogt "regards
it, with reference to the proportion of length to breadth,
as one of the most ill-favored, animal-like and simian of
skulls."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The cause of this wide difference of opinion may arise
from the failure to observe the fact that the older the formation
in which a skull is found, the lower is the type. The
ordinary observer, judging by the cast of the skull, would see
nothing ape-like about it, and certainly would fail to see any
indications of a philosopher.</p>


<p class="center">NEANDERTHAL SKULL.</p>

<p>The Neanderthal skull was taken from a small cave or
grotto in-the valley of the D&uuml;ssel, near D&uuml;sseldorf, situated
about seventy miles north-east of the region of the Li&eacute;ge
caverns. The grotto is in a deep ravine sixty feet above the
river, one hundred feet below the surface of the country, and
at a distance of about ten feet from the D&uuml;ssel River. It is
fifteen feet deep from the entrance (<i>f</i>), which is seven or
eight feet wide. Before the cavern had been injured, it
opened upon a narrow plateau lying in front. The floor of
the cave was covered four or five feet in thickness with a
deposit of mud or loam, and containing some rounded fragments
of chert. Two laborers, in removing this deposit, first
noticed the skull, placed near the entrance, and further in
met with the other bones. As the bones were not regarded
as of any importance, at the time of their discovery, only the
larger ones have been preserved.</p>

</div>


<p>Some discussion has arisen in respect to the geological
time of these bones. There was no stalagmite overlying the
mud or loam in which the skeleton was found, and no other
bones met with save the tusk of a bear. There is no certain
data given whereby its position may be known. Professor
Huxley declares that the bones "indicate a very high antiquity."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Buchner is very positive in his statement, and
declares that "the loam-deposit which partly fills the caves
of the Neanderthal and the clefts and fissures of its limestone
mountains, and in which both the Neanderthal bones
and the fossil bones and teeth of animals were imbedded, is
exactly the same that, in the caverns of the Neanderthal,
covers the whole limestone mountain with a deposit from ten
to twelve feet in thickness, and the diluvial origin of which
is unmistakable."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Dr. Fuhlrott says, "The position and
general arrangement of the locality in which they were found,
place it, in my judgment, beyond doubt that the bones
belong to the diluvium, and therefore to primitive times, <i>i. e.</i>
they come down to us from a period of the past when our
native country was still inhabited by various kinds of animals,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
especially mammoths and cave-bears, which have long since
disappeared out of the series of living creatures."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The diluvial or glacial origin of the Neanderthal skull is
still further confirmed by the discoveries made, in the
summer of 1865, in the Teufelskammer. This cavern is
situated one hundred and thirty paces from the one in which
the human bones were found, and on the same side of the
river.. In the loam-deposit of this cave were found numerous
fossil bones and teeth of the rhinoceros, cave-bear, cave-hyena,
and other extinct animals. "A great part of these
bones, especially those of the cave-bears, agree in color,
weight, density, and the preservation of their microscopic
structure, with the human bones found in the Feldhofner
Cave (in which the Neanderthal man was found), and both
are covered with the same <i>dendrites</i>, or tree-like markings."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Before entering into a description and discussion of this
remarkable skull, an enumeration of the other bones will be
given. All the bones are characterized by their unusual
thickness, and the great development of all the elevations
and depressions for the attachment of muscles. The two
thigh bones were in a perfect state, also the right humerus
and radius; the upper third of the right ulna; the left ulna
complete, though pathologically deformed, the coronoid
process being so much enlarged by bony growth that flexure
of the elbow beyond a right angle was impossible; the left
humerus is much slenderer than the right, and the upper
third is wanting. Its anterior fossa for the reception of the
coronoid process is filled up with a bony growth, and, at
the same time, the olecranon process is curved strongly
downwards. The indications are that an injury sustained
during life was the cause of this defect. There was an ilium,
almost perfect; a fragment of the right scapula; the anterior
extremity of a rib of the right side, and two hinder
portions and one middle portion of ribs resembling more the
ribs of a carnivorous animal than those of man. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
abnormal condition has arisen from the powerful development
of the thoracic muscles.</p>

</p>
</div>



<p>The cranium is thus described by Professor Huxley. "It
has an extreme length of 8 inches, while its breadth is only
5&frac34; inches, or in other words, its length is to its breadth as
100 is to 72. It is exceedingly depressed, measuring
only about 3.4 inches from the glabello-occipital line to
the vertex. The longitudinal arc, measured in the same way
as in the Engis skull, is 12 inches; the transverse arc cannot
be exactly ascertained, in consequence of the absence of the
temporal bones, but was probably about the same, and certainly
exceeded 10&frac14; inches. The horizontal circumference is
23 inches. But this great circumference arises largely from
the vast development of the superciliary ridges, though the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
perimeter of the brain case itself is not small. The large
superciliary ridges give the forehead a far more retreating
appearance than its internal contour would bear out. To an
anatomical eye the posterior part of the skull is even more
striking than the anterior. The occipital protuberance occupies
the extreme posterior end of the skull, when the glabello-occipital
line is made horizontal, and so far from any part of
the occipital region extending beyond it, this region of the
skull slopes obliquely upward and forward, so that the lambdoidal
suture is situated well upon the upper surface of the
cranium. At the same time, notwithstanding the great
length of the skull, the sagittal suture is remarkably short
(4&frac12; inches) and the squamosal suture is very straight."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
... "The cranium, in its present condition, contains about
sixty-three English cubic inches of water. As the entire
skull could hardly have held less than twelve cubic inches
more, its minimum capacity may be estimated at seventy-five
cubic inches.... It has certainly not undergone compression,
and, in reply to the suggestion that the skull is that
of an idiot, it may be urged that the <i>onus probandi</i> lies with
those who adopt the hypothesis. Idiocy is compatible with
very various forms and capacities of the cranium, but I know
of none which present the least resemblance to the Neanderthal
skull."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Professor Huxley describes this skull to be the most ape-like
of all the human skulls he has ever seen, and in its
examination ape-like characters are met with in all its
parts.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Buchner says that the face of the Neanderthal
man must have presented a frightfully bestial and savage, or
ape-like expression (see frontispiece).<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Professor Schaaffhausen
and Mr. Busk have stated that "this skull is the
most brutal of all known human skulls, resembling those of
the apes not only in the prodigious development of the superciliary
prominences and the forward extension of the orbits,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
but still more in the depressed form of the brain-case, in the
straightness of the squamosal suture, and in the complete
retreat of the occiput forward and upward, from the superior
occipital ridges."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Professor Schaaffhausen and Dr. Buchner regarded this
skull as a race-type, and Professor Huxley has said "that it
truly forms only the extreme member of a series leading by
slow degrees to the highest and best developed forms of
human skulls."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>That this skull is a race-type is evident from the fact
that it is not an isolated case. The fragment of the skull
from the loess of the Rhine (Alsace), by its depressed forehead
and strongly projecting superciliary arches, greatly
resembles the Neanderthal skull. The skull from the calcareous
tuff of Constatt, in its low, narrow forehead and strong
superciliary arches, resembles the Neanderthal.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The cranium
found in bone breccia, in Cochrane's Cave (Gibraltar),
"resembles, in all essential particulars, including its great
thickness, the far-famed Neanderthal skull. Its discovery
adds immensely to the scientific value of the Neanderthal
specimen, if only as showing that the latter does not represent,
as many have hitherto supposed, a mere individual peculiarity,
but that it may have been characteristic of a race
extending from the Rhine to the Pillars of Hercules."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> In
speaking of the Neanderthal skull, Professor Schaaffhausen
says, "It is worthy of notice that a similar, although smaller
projection of the superciliary arches has generally been found
in the skulls of savage races.... The remarkably
small skull from the graves on the island of Mo&euml;n, examined
by Professor Eschricht; the two human skulls, described by
Dr. Kutorga, from the government of Minsk (Russia), one of

<h3>PRE-GLACIAL EPOCHS.</h3>


<p>The age immediately preceding the glacial, and consequently
the post-tertiary, is known as the pliocene epoch,
the last of the tertiary.</p>

<p>The tertiary period began with the close of the cretaceous.
A map of the early tertiary period would represent
parts of Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, the
whole of Florida, the lower parts of Alabama, Mississippi,
Texas, the whole of Louisiana, and the adjoining territory on
both sides of the Mississippi, as far as Cairo, as covered with
water. Also a great sea extending through Nebraska and
the western part of Dacotah, and taking a north-westerly
course until it emptied into the Pacific. In Europe, the
great basin of Paris (excepting a zone of chalk), the greater
part of Spain and Italy, the whole of Belgium, Holland,
Prussia, Switzerland, Hungary, Wallachia, and northern
Russia, as one vast sheet of water. England and France
were connected by a band of rocks.</p>

<p>About the middle of the tertiary, a tropical climate and
tropical fauna and flora spread over the whole of Europe.
Palms, cedars, laurels, and cinnamon trees flourished in the
valleys of Switzerland, and more than thirty different species
of oak adorned the forests of that time.</p>

<p>In Europe, in the eocene, there have been found thirty
species of crocodiles; many species of snakes, one twenty
feet long; a dozen species of birds; tapirs (<i>Pal&aelig;othere</i> and
<i>Lophiodon</i>), two species of hogs, some ruminants and rodents.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>In the miocene, among <i>Pachyderms</i> may be mentioned the
mastodon, elephant, dinothere (an elephantine animal), rhinoceros,
hog, horse, tapir, and hippopotamus; among
<i>Carnivores</i>, the machairodus, hyena, lion, and dog; among
<i>Ruminants</i>, the camel, deer, and antelope. There were
monkeys, and many other animals.</p>

<p>In the pliocene, besides those enumerated, are found the
bear, hare, and other animals.</p>

<p>In the tertiary beds of America have been found mastodons,
elephants, rhinoceroses, deer, camels, foxes, wolves,
horses, whales, and other mammalia.</p>

<p>Owing to the great lapse of time it cannot be expected
that many traces of man will be discovered in this early
period.</p>

<p>Upon theoretical grounds Lyell thought it very probable
that man lived in the pliocene; but in relation to miocene
time, he says, "Had some other rational being, representing
man, then flourished, some signs of his existence could hardly
have escaped unnoticed, in the shape of implements of stone
or metal, more frequent and more durable than the osseous
remains of any of the mammalia."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Sir J. Lubbock, while
admitting the existence of man in the pliocene, goes farther
and says, "If man constitutes a separate family of mammalia,
as he does in the opinion of the highest authorities, then,
according to all pal&aelig;ontological analogies, he must have had
representatives in miocene times. We need not, however,
expect to find the proofs in Europe; our nearest relatives in
the animal kingdom are confined to hot, almost to tropical
climates, and it is in such countries that we are most likely
to find the earliest traces of the human race."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Alfred R.
Wallace out-distances any of his cotemporaries, for he says,
"We are enabled to place the origin of man at a much more
remote geological epoch than has yet been thought possible.
He may even have lived in the miocene or eocene period,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
when not a single mammal was identical in form with any
existing species."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Some of the older and some of the recent discoveries of
geologists have settled the question of tertiary man; and the
"signs of his existence," in the "shape of implements of
stone," as demanded by Lyell, have been furnished.</p>

<p><i>Man in the Pliocene.</i>&mdash;It has already been intimated that
the evidences of man are but few in this early epoch. The
first example, in the following list, borders closely on the
glacial, but far enough removed as to be referred to the
pliocene.</p>

<p>In the construction of a canal between Stockholm and
Gothenburg it was necessary to cut through one of those hills
called <i>osars</i>, or erratic blocks, which were deposited by the
drift-ice during the glacial epoch. Beneath an immense
accumulation of osars, with shells and sand, there was
discovered in the deepest layer of subsoil, at a depth of about
sixty feet, a circular mass of stones, forming a hearth, in the
middle of which there were wood-coals. No other hand than
that of man could have performed the work.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>In the pliocene beds in the neighborhood of the town of
Savonia in Liguria, M. A. Issel found several bones which
presented all the physical signs of very high antiquity. Dr.
Buchner is of the opinion that before these bones can be employed
as satisfactory evidence they must have a more
accurate test by scientific authorities.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>In the upper pliocene beds at St. Prest (France), M. Desnoyers
found traces of human action on the bones of animals
belonging to the tertiary. These fractures are analogous to
those of human action observed on bones from the glacial
period, and identical with those made by northern tribes of
the present day, on the skulls of ruminants. The marked
bones found were those of the Southern elephant (<i>E. meridionalis</i>),
rhinoceros (<i>R. leptorinus</i>), hippopotamus major,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
several species of deer, and two of the ox. Carl Vogt states
that this discovery is not only genuine, but also, the formation
in which the bones were found is decidedly tertiary. It is
further characterized by the presence of the southern elephant
(<i>E. meridionalis</i>). As this elephant became extinct before
the glacial age, the bones consequently precede the glacial,
and the age of the cave-bear, the mammoth, and tichorrhine
rhinoceros. The eminent French naturalist, Quatrefages,
confirms the testimony of Desnoyers.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The conclusions of Desnoyers are confirmed beyond a
doubt by the more recent discoveries of Abb&eacute; Bourgeois.
In the same tertiary strata of St. Prest, in which were found
the marked or fractured bones, Bourgeois discovered worked
flints, including flakes, awls, and scrapers.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>A human skull, belonging to the pliocene, was found by
James Matson, at Altaville, in Calaveras county, California,
at a depth of one hundred and thirty feet, under five beds of
gravel separated by five layers of lava, associated with the
bones of an extinct rhinoceros, camel, and horse. The base
of the skull is imbedded in a mass of bone-breccia and small
pebbles of volcanic rock. The shape of the skull resembles
that of the Digger Indians, and is of remarkable thickness.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span><i>Man in the Miocene.</i><a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>&mdash;M. Bourgeois has found, in a
stratum of miocene near Pontlevoy, numerous worked flints,
and other flints which have been subjected to the action of
heat. These works of man were associated with the remains
of the acerotherium (an extinct species allied to the rhinoceros),
and beneath five distinct beds, one of which contained
the rolled bones of rhinoceros, mastodon, and dinotherium.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>M. Tardy found a flint-flake of undoubted workmanship
in the miocene beds of Aurillac (Auvergne), together with
the remains of <i>dinotherium giganteum</i>, and <i>machaerodus
latidens</i>.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>M. Bourgeois reports that Abb&eacute; Delaunay had found near
Pouance (Maine-et-Loire), fossil bones of a <i>halitherium</i> (an
herbivorous cetacean of the miocene), with evident signs of
having been operated upon by cutting instruments.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>In the miocene gravel beds of Colorado and Wyoming
territories, chert-flakes, hammers, chisels, knives, and
wrought shells have been found.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>CONDITION OF MAN IN THE EARLIEST TIMES.</h3>


<p>Of the first appearance of man on the globe there is no
precise knowledge. His origin is a mystery. The place of
his birth is generally supposed to be in Central Asia. There
the geologist looks with a longing eye, and hopes ultimately
to unravel, not only the hidden mystery of the birth-place of
his race, but also, how or through what natural process he
sprang into existence.</p>

<p>If the miocene be the earliest point in his history, and
Central Asia the place of his nativity, then he was ushered
upon the scene of life during the period of, and surrounded
by, the numerous fauna of India, At this time her mammalia
included, besides the quadrumana, elephant (seven
species), mastodon (three species), rhinoceros (five species),
horse (three species), hippopotamus (four to seven species),
hog (three species), camel, giraffe, sivatherium (an elephantine
stag, having four horns and supposed to have had the
bulk of an elephant and greater height), antelope, musk-deer,
sheep, ox (several species), dinotherium, porcupine,
species of hyena, lion, and many others.</p>

<p>It cannot be presumed that man's intellectual faculties
were ordinarily developed, as it would not be natural to
suppose he was superior to that of later times. Judging
from the remains of later times, man could have been but
very little removed from the brute. It is natural to suppose
that at first he had no fire, no weapons of offence or defence.
His food must have been the herbs, roots, and the fruits
of the tree, possibly with an occasional morsel of raw meat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
His pillow was a stone, his retreat a cave or the boughs of a
wide-spreading tree, and his clothing a natural coat of hair.</p>

<p>In the presence of the fierce beasts, man's domain might
seem to be of short duration. Providence has ordered all
things wisely. Placed low in the scale of life&mdash;brutal, selfish,
prowling, yet cautious&mdash;man, by the very force of
circumstances, was to develop gradually the powers of his
mind. With the elephant and the mastodon he could not
cope nor would they molest him. To the fierce carnivora he
might fall a prey. From these he could flee, and find a
shelter in the tops of the trees or some secure fastness of the
earth. Learning his own strength by experience, he would
venture forth on excursions, and meet face to face his deadly
foe. For self-defence he discovered, probably by accident,
that a club was a powerful weapon with which to beat back
his fierce opponent. Gradually he came to learn that a sharp
flint driven into the end of a club was a safer and more
deadly weapon. With this he could withstand an unequal
contest.</p>

<p>The mode of life, together with the trials of his strength,
developed his muscular system. His muscles became large
and tough, and his bones thick and heavy. The earliest type
of man is generally supposed to be <i>dolichocephalic</i>, or long-headed.
The walls of the skull were thick, and the crown
low. He was of ordinary stature, but built for action, and
of great power. His make-up was the result of his surroundings.</p>

<p>His advancement was very slow. Throughout the entire
length of the miocene and pliocene epochs it is not traceable.
There was no revolution in his mind; one step in advance
would have been a mighty leap. Nor could it be expected
that there should be rapid progress. The mind was brutal;
and all the instincts sensual. But there was pending a
mighty change. The tropical climate should change into a
winter of snow and ice. Man should feel it, and be benefited
by the new danger. His sluggish mind should be quickened,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
and the inventive genius should be called into action. The
sun no longer could give its heat. The forests grew cold, the
chilling winds swept over the plains, and the retreat in the
cave was damp and forbidding. The wild beasts were either
dying of cold, or else becoming clothed with thick, long hair,
and retreating before the accumulating snow. Man earnestly
looked about him. He suffered greatly, and his numbers
grew less. Fire had been produced. How, no one can tell;
possibly by accident. He now became more careful of the
fire, and with brand in hand he went from place to place
kindling the fires at the various resting-places. Nor was this
sufficient. His ingenuity was taxed to its greatest extent.
Colder and colder grew the winds. The snow, coming in
great flakes, was soon consolidated, and became as ice. The
body could not be kept warm. Clothing must be had, and
this must be furnished by the wild beasts. Their hides must
assist in protecting the life of man. The stiffened, frozen
animals would not alone furnish sufficient covering. Knives
must be invented. From the flint rude knives were fashioned,
by means of which the skins were removed and transferred to
the bodies of men. But the long winter continuing, the lives
of the living animals must be forfeited, both for the flesh and
and the skins. Rude, almost shapeless arrow-heads were
produced. Wood must be had with which to warm and
cook, and rude rafts formed, by means of which the swelling
rivers might be crossed. Then those stone hatchets of the
Somme were shaped, and answered the purpose.</p>

<p>Man was at last prepared to face the rigors of winter, the
perils of ice, and secure himself against starvation. Not content
with his conflicts with nature, his brutal passion is
aroused against his fellows. Death-dealing blows fall rapidly
upon each other, the blood flows freely, the bones give way,
and the weaker one has succumbed. There are fierce contentions
over the common prey, and the strong impose upon the
weak. True to his instinct, he is gregarious. He lives in communities;
and the more daring&mdash;the hunters&mdash;having their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
common places of meeting, fashion their weapons, and vie
with each other in feats of prowess.</p>

<p>During the glacial epoch the condition of man must have
remained unchanged, after he had supplied himself with rude
stone weapons. His time was spent, for the most part, in
self-preservation. He was retreating before, yet bounding
over, the frozen flood in pursuit of game. This experience
must ultimately tell for good. When the glaciers began to
recede, man followed closely, and forgot not the value of those
stone weapons which had secured food for himself. They
served against the cave-bear, cave-hyena, cave-lion, and
would be of great service in the ages yet to come. By a little
remodelling they could be used to greater advantage; and this
change of shape was accomplished, and other uses of flint
were made known.</p>

<p>Man's form, aspect, and true position are comprehended
by the relics of the glacial age. The human bones tell a tale
which any anatomist may read, and even one not well skilled
in the art. The primitive type is no mystery, and those
fossil bones tell of the terrific strifes of by-gone times.</p>

<p>The Neanderthal man has already been described. Its
structure is animal. Its history agrees with the generally
received idea of primitive man as conceived by the geologist.
The illustration (frontispiece) presents him bestial and ape-like.
A powerful organization, and well adapted to those
times. His bones tell of fearful conflicts. He lived to an
old age, as the traces of every suture are effaced. His skull
was very thick. The strong, prominent superciliary arches
denote large perceptives, making him watchful and always on
the alert. Those bones tell of a terrible conflict. The left
arm was broken; who knows but in a contest with the great
cave-bear. He survived the contest and lived to see that arm
dwindle and become almost useless. Over the right eye he
received a blow, from some source, so great as to carry away
a portion of the bone. The claw of a cave-bear, or a flint
weapon in the hand of one of his race, may have produced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
that fracture. Still he lived, and the wound healed. All
this tells of his strength and hardihood. It gives an inside
view of the wonderful hardships and vicissitudes of primeval
man.</p>

<p>The Engis skull belongs to the same type, though less
bestial. Possibly this individual did not enter upon the
chase, and engage in the manly pursuits of those times. He
may have been an adviser or a dandy; or, his ingenuity may
have led him to the vocation of fashioning weapons and implements
from the flint.</p>

<p>In the time of the Engis man there were large as well as
short, heavy-set men. In the same cavern there was found a
clavicle belonging to a young person who must have been of
great stature.</p>

<p>The jaws of La Naulette and Moulin-Quignon display a
great tendency to animal structure, and confirm the impressions
as given of the primitive condition of man during the
glacial and pre-glacial ages.</p>

<h3>INTER-GLACIAL EPOCH.</h3>


<p>The glaciers have departed. Summer comes again.
The forests bloom and the wild beast roams about. Many
species withstood the long siege of cold; others perished;
still others followed the ice as it retreated, preferring the
cold to the coming heat. The floods had abated and man
spread himself over the different tracts blooming with flowers
and radiant with earthly splendors.</p>

<p>The evidences of man's existence during this period are
numerous, consisting in works of art and fossil remains.
Only a few examples are given, as not many will be required
to present the evidence and show man's condition.</p>

<p>The hyena-den at Wokey Hole, explored by Mr. Dawkins,
affords specimens of the works of man. When discovered
this den was filled to the roof with <i>d&eacute;bris</i>. Under this
rubbish was found several layers of the excrement of the
cave-hyena (<i>H. spel&aelig;a</i>), each of which indicates an old floor
and a separate period of occupation.</p>

<p>The implements were under these layers of excrement,
showing that the cave had been occupied by the hyenas after
the time of the savages. These implements had not been
disturbed by the action of water. In the bone earth along
with the remains of the cave-hyena were found those of the
mammoth, Siberian rhinoceros, (<i>R. tichorrhinus</i>), gigantic ox
(<i>Bos primigenius</i>), gigantic Irish deer (<i>Megaceros Hibernicus</i>),
reindeer, cave-bear, cave-lion (<i>Felis spel&aelig;a</i>), wolf (<i>Canis
lupus</i>), fox (<i>Canis vulpes</i>), and the teeth and bones of the
horse in great numbers. Intermixed with these bones were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>chipped flints, a bleached flint weapon of the spear-head
Amiens type, and arrow-heads made of bone.</p>

<p>On the right is shown the megatherium. This animal belonged to the sloth tribe, and was a native of South America. It exceeded in
size the largest rhinocerous, and the length of its skeleton sometimes attained eighteen feet. In front, near the centre, is the glyptodon
another South American animal of the armadillo tribe. The length of its shell, along the curve, was five feet, and the total length of the
animal, nine feet. Just back of the glypodon, and holding on to a tree, is the mylodon, belonging to both North and South America, one
species of which was much larger than the western buffalo. On the left, and in the rear, is the mastodon, the remains of which are found
in both North and South America, though of different species. While this scene does not represent the animals with which we are dealing,

<p>In the cavern of Maccagnone, in Sicily, there were
found ashes and rude flint implements in a breccia containing
the bones of the elephant (<i>E. antiquus</i>), hyena, a large bear,
lion, (probably <i>F. spel&aelig;a</i>), and large numbers of bones<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
belonging to the hippopotamus. The concrete of ashes had
once filled the cavern, and a large piece of bone breccia was
still cemented to the roof.</p>

<p>The vast number of hippopotamuses implies that the physical
condition of the country was different from what it is at
present. The bone breccia cemented to the roof, and coated
with stalagmite, testifies that the cave, at some time since the
formation of the breccia, has been washed out. The exact
time of the formation of this breccia cannot be given, but, in
all probability, not long after the extinction of the cave-bear,
if not before.</p>

<p>The cave or grotto of Aurignac, in which the seventeen
human skeletons were found, was carefully examined by
Lartet eight years after its discovery. The recess was formed
in nummulitic limestone. In front of the grotto, and next to
the limestone (<i>c</i>, Fig. 12) was a layer of ashes and charcoal,
eight inches thick, containing hearth-stones, works of art, and
broken, burned, and gnawed bones of extinct and recent
mammalia. Immediately above this layer (<i>d</i>) was another, of
made ground, two feet thick, extending into the grotto; and
its contents similar to the other, save that within the grotto
were found a few human bones. The grotto was closed by a
slab, and the made earth without was covered by a talus of
rubbish (<i>e</i>), washed down from the hill above.</p>

<p>In these layers were found not less than one hundred flint
instruments, consisting of knives, projectiles, sling-stones,
chips, and a stone made for the purpose of modelling the
flints. The bone implements were barbless arrows, a well-shaped
and sharply pointed bodkin made of the horn of the
roe-deer, and other tools made of reindeer horn. Besides
these there were found eighteen small round and flat plates,
of a white shelly substance, made of some species of cockle
(<i>cardium</i>), pierced through the middle; also the tusk of a
young cave-bear, the crown of which had been carved in imitation
of the head of a bird.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the different species found in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>

<p>The bones on the outside of the grotto were found to be
split open, as if for the extraction of the marrow, and many
of them burned. The spongy parts were wanting, having
been gnawed off by the hyenas.</p>

<p>M. Lartet came to the conclusion that this grotto was a
place of sepulchre, and the broken or split bones were the
remnants of the funeral feasts. This he argued from the
fact that the bones within the grotto were not split, broken
or gnawed, save the astragalus of the mammoth. This meat
was placed in the grotto, probably as an offering to the dead.
The bones without the cave were scraped, and while the men
were yet engaged in the funeral feast, the hyenas prowled
about the spot, and at the close of the banquet, devoured the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
flesh that remained. The slab in front of the cave debarred
their entrance, and consequently the bones and human
remains within were left untouched.</p>

<p>The observations made by M. Cartailhac, in 1870, lead to
different conclusions. On close inspection, he discovered a
difference in the color of the walls of the cave, indicating that
the lower deposit was of a yellow color, and the next above
of a much lighter tint. In the crevices of the lower he
found a tooth of the rhinoceros, one of the reindeer, and
some fractured bones of the cave-bear. In the higher deposit
occurred some small bones of living animals and of man, and
a fragment of pottery. From these evidences, M. Cartailhac
inferred that the lower deposits of the grotto corresponded
with that outside of it, and the layer containing human bones
was formed at a subsequent time.</p>

<p>That this grotto was a place of resort at a very early
period is proven from the numerous remains of the cave-bear.
This animal was one of the first of those great post-tertiary
mammalia to become extinct. The exact position of
the remains of the reindeer is not given. If its bones were
intermixed with the others and found in the lowest as well as
the other layers, it would indicate that the climate was not
very warm during the deposit of the layers, but to have been
similar to that of Switzerland of the present day. The
probability is, the reindeer bones did not occur in the lowest
layer, and hence that layer was formed during the tropical
climate, and the reindeer bones and human skeletons were
consigned to the grotto about the close of the inter-glacial,
or beginning of the reindeer epoch.</p>

<p>The fossil man of Denise, taken from an old volcanic tuff,
must be assigned to this period, since there have been found,
in similar blocks of tuff in the same region, the remains of
the cave-hyena and hippopotamus major. This fossil man
consists of a frontal part of the skull, the upper jaw, with
teeth, belonging to both an adult and young individual; a
radius, some lumbar vertebr&aelig;, and some metatarsal bones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
The tuff is light and porous, and none of the bones penetrate
into the more compact rock.</p>

<p>In the rubbish heap, or reindeer station, at the source of
the Schusse, there were discovered more than six hundred
split flints, with a quantity of partly worked antlers and bones
of the reindeer. The bones were so numerous that Mr. Oscar
Fraas was enabled to put together a complete skeleton of the
reindeer which is now preserved in the museum of Stuttgart.
Most of the bones were split open for the purpose of extracting
the marrow. There were numerous remains of fishes, and
a fish-hook manufactured from reindeer horn. There were
also the bones of other animals, such as the glutton, arctic
fox, and other animals now living in high northern latitudes.</p>

<p>Speaking of this station, Dr. Buchner says, "Not only the
careful investigations of the geognostic conditions of the
place, but also the flora of the time (for remains of mosses
were found which now live only in the extreme north), leave
no doubt that the reindeer station on the Schusse belongs to
the glacial epoch, or that it probably belongs exactly to the
interval between the two glacial epochs which in all probability
Switzerland has experienced. Mr. E. Desor declared
this deposit to be <i>the terminal moraine of the Rhine-glacier</i>,
which was formerly very large. Moreover, according to him,
this discovery is particularly remarkable, because it is the
first example of a station of the reindeer-men in a free and
open deposit, their remains having hitherto been found only
in caves."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>From the remarks of Dr. Buchner, the great number of
bones of the reindeer, and some show of advancement in the
arts, it may be safe to conclude that this station belongs to
the close of the inter-glacial.</p>

<h3>CONDITION OF MAN IN THE INTER-GLACIAL.</h3>


<p>The Inter-Glacial period continued a great length of
time, covering many thousands of years.</p>

<p>Man is an improvable being, and some advancement may
be expected in his condition. His mode of life, and continued
conflicts with the fierce wild beasts, would tax his
every device. Necessity compelled him to be inventive.
The limited, bestial mind which he possessed, could not
grapple with the higher problems of existence. United
efforts and fortified places were beyond his thoughts. Those
old axes of flint were great objects to his mind, and one step
beyond them was a great stride in progress. That they
developed but little cannot be wondered at, not only from
their low type, but also from the knowledge that even in the
era of history there are nations whose civilization has become
fixed and stereotyped for ages; others, who, instead of advancing,
have been retrograding.</p>

<p>The impulse given by the rigors of glacial times acted
beneficially throughout this period. The rude axes and
flints were retained, but improvements were made in utilizing
the bones and horns of animals. Out of these, bodkins,
fish-hooks, and arrow-heads were made. The teeth of wild
animals were perforated, and, along with corals and shells,
were used for ornaments. The caverns, used as dwelling-places,
being destitute of water, this necessary of life was
supplied and carried thither in rude vessels made of clay and
dried in the sun. The arrows, flint knives, and axes were
used for killing and skinning the animals, splitting the bones
containing the marrow, shaping the bone implements, felling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
trees, and stripping the bark, which was used at times for
clothing, after having been softened by beating. He commenced
the art of engraving, as is witnessed by a sketch of
the great cave-bear wrought on a curious stone found in the
cave of Massat (Ari&eacute;ge), the bird's head formed from the bone
of a cave-bear, at Aurignac, and other examples. The lower
jaw-bones of the cave-bear and cave-lion, in the shape of
hoes, used for digging roots, were found in the caves of Lherm
and in Bouicheta. He made hearth-stones, and on them
cooked his food. That he paid honors to the dead, and sheltered
them from the ravages of beasts of prey, at present,
must remain an open question. If he did, it might seem to
imply that he had a religious nature. But when it is considered
that he was very low in the scale of existence, it may be
inferred that this was done, if done at all, to propitiate an
evil genius. Or it may be a faint idea of a ghost state and
that these feasts were made to dissuade the ghost from
molesting him. That they had a conception of a Supreme
Ruler, or a number of gods who ruled for the good of man,
would be too preposterous to believe.</p>

<p>Professor Denton has given a description of primeval
time which, by a little change, would represent inter-glacial
times: "The seasons are fairly established; and spring
follows winter, and fall summer, as now; though the summer
is longer and warmer than we are accustomed to see in
those countries at the present time, and the winters colder.
The country is covered with dense forests, through which
ramble mighty elephants in herds, with immense curved
tusks, coats of long, shaggy hair, and flowing manes....
Shuffling along comes the great cave-bear from his rocky den&mdash;as
large as a horse: fierce, shaggy, conscious of his strength,
he fears no adversary. Crouched by a bubbling spring lies
the cave-tiger (<i>Felis spel&aelig;a</i>); and, as the wild cattle come
down to drink, he leaps upon the back of one, and a terrible
combat ensues. It is as large as an elephant, and its horns<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
of enormous size; and even cave-tigers could not always
master such cattle as they.</p>

<p>"Are these the highest forms of life that the country
contains? What being is that sitting on yon fallen tree?
His long arms are in front of his hairy body, and his
hands between his knees; while his long legs are dangling
down. His complexion is darker than an Indian's; his
beard short, and like the hair of his body; the unkempt hair
of his head is bushy and thick; his eyebrows are short and
crisp; and with his sloping forehead and brutal countenance,
he seems like the caricature of a man, rather than an
actual human being.</p>

<p>"Beneath the shade of a spreading chestnut we may behold
a group&mdash;one old man ... and women and children,
lounging and lying upon the ground. How dirty! What
forbidding countenances!&mdash;more like furies than women.
One young man, with a stone axe, is separating the bark from
a neighboring tree. Others, agile as monkeys, are climbing
the trees, and passing from branch to branch, as they gather
the wild fruit that abounds on every side. Some are catching
fish in the shallows of the river, and yell with triumph as
they hold their captives by the gills, dragging them to the
shore."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>They have improved their language, and instead of the
rude signs and undistinguishable sounds of the glacial, may
now be heard short, but occasional sentences, which were the
forerunners of the polished tongues of modern Europe.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>REINDEER EPOCH.</h3>


<p>The glaciers, to a limited extent, have again advanced.
The gigantic animals of the past age have either disappeared
or are fast becoming extinct. The great cave-bear, cave-lion,
cave-hyena, mammoth, and woolly-haired rhinoceros have
almost become extinct. They have given way to a less fierce
and less gigantic fauna. The advance of the glaciers is
announced by the numerous herds of reindeer which are
overrunning the forests of Western Europe, and extending as
far south as the Pyrenees. In the forests there now existed
the horse, bison, wild bull (<i>Bos primigenius</i>), musk-ox, elk,
deer, chamois, ibex, beaver, hamster-rat, lemming, and many
others. These animals were capable of withstanding and
flourishing in a rigorous climate. When the glaciers were
again broken up and the climate became warmer, the reindeer,
musk-ox, elk, chamois, wild-goat, hamster-rat, and
lemming retired to the high northern latitudes in close proximity
to the snow, or else to the lofty summits of great
mountain-chains.</p>

<p>The evidences of the antiquity of the reindeer epoch, and
that it immediately followed the inter-glacial, are numerous.
The vast number of the reindeer bones and horns attest to a
distinct epoch, and by the remains of arctic animals, as well as
the traces of glaciers, the climate must have been unlike that
of the present time. The remains of the mammoth, cave-bear,
and cave-lion, would not only connect this period with
the inter-glacial, but also prove that a few stragglers continued
to exist, at least for a short period, after the reindeer epoch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
had begun. That this epoch was earlier than the Swiss lake-villages,
or Danish shell mounds, may be shown by the weapons
or implements which point to a more primitive people,
the absence of the remains of the dog, and, also, by the
absence of the remains of the reindeer in the shell-mounds.</p>

<p>There are no means, yet discovered, by which it can be
told how long this epoch lasted. It lasted a sufficient length
of time to permit the reindeer to increase greatly its species.</p>

<p><i>Evidences of the Existence of Man.</i>&mdash;M. Christy and M.
Lartet examined in conjunction the caves of Central and
Southern France. Those which have been most carefully
examined are ten in number, and belong to the Department
of Dordogne. At Perigord there seems to have been quite a
settlement, judging by the number of caves and stations, the
principal ones being Les Eyzies, La Madeleine, Laugerie-Haute,
and Laugerie-Basse.</p>

<p>At Les Eyzies there were found a flint bodkin and a bone
needle used for sewing, a barbed arrow made of reindeer
horn and still fixed in a bone, a flint whistle made from the
first joint of the foot of the reindeer, and two slabs of schist,
on both of which were scratched animal forms, but deficient
in any special characteristic.</p>

<p>At La Madeleine there were found a geode very large and
very thick, which, it is supposed, was used for a cooking
vessel, as one side of it had been subjected to fire; an
engraving of a reindeer on the horn of that animal; on
another horn the carved outlines of two fishes, one on either
side; a representation of an ibex on the palm of a horn; on
another, a very curious group, consisting of an eel, a human
figure, and two horses' heads. A slab of ivory, broken into
five pieces, had an outline sketch of the mammoth (Fig. 13).
This was so accurately drawn that the small eye, curved
tusks, huge trunk, and the abundant mane, could readily be
distinguished. There was also found, on an arrow-head, the
figure of a tadpole.</p>

<p>There were workshops at Laugerie-Haute and Laugerie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>-Basse,
where weapons and utensils were manufactured; and
they are noted for the abundance of instruments made of
reindeer horn. Among the works of art found at the latter
station may be mentioned, the stiletto, needle, spoon made in
the shape of rods tapering off at one end and hollow in the
middle, staff of authority, whistle, and harpoon, all from the
horn of the reindeer. On the head of a staff of authority is
carved a mammoth's head; there is a representation of the
hind-quarters of some herbivorous animal, sketched out with
a bold and practiced touch; an animal's head, with ears laid
back, and of considerable length, is carved on a round shaft
of reindeer horn. It cannot be determined for what purpose
this shaft was intended, but as the other end was pointed,
and provided with a lateral hook, it may have been the
harpoon of some chief. On a slab of slate was drawn, in outline,
a reindeer fight. On a fragment of a spear-head there is
a series of human hands, provided with four fingers only,
and represented in demi-relief. The delineations of fish are
principally on wands of authority&mdash;on one of which is a series
following one another.</p>

</div>

<p>The cave and <i>rock shelters</i> of Bruniquel (Tarn-et-Garonne)
have been carefully examined by competent explorers. These
relics are so numerous that M. de Lastic, the proprietor of
the cavern, sold to the agent of the British Museum fifteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
hundred specimens, of every description, which had been
found on his property. In the cave there were found,
engraved on a bone, a perfectly recognizable horse's head and
the head of a reindeer, and daggers made of ivory and bone,
on which were representations of the above-mentioned
animals. The engravings are mostly on the horn of the reindeer.
The cave has also furnished two almost perfect
human skulls, and two half-jaw bones which resemble the
Moulin-Quignon.</p>

<p>The <i>rock-shelters</i> are overhanging rocks, under the projections
of which man found a shelter and built his rude
dwellings of boughs and sticks. In these shelters have been
found fire-hearths, fish-hooks made of splinters of bone,
saws made of flint, a complete sketch of the mammoth
engraved on reindeer horn, the hilt of a dagger carved in the
shape of a reindeer, the cave-lion, engraved with great clearness,
on a fragment of a staff of authority, and two daggers
made of ivory.</p>

<p>In the excavations which were made in the rock-shelters,
was found a quantity of human bones, including two skulls&mdash;one
of an old man, the other that of an adult.</p>

<p>The cave of Gourdan (Haute-Garonne) contained the
largest collection of implements of bone and horn ever discovered.
The stones and reindeer horns are carved with
great care, and indicate a high degree of artistic taste. There
are sketches made of the reindeer, stag, chamois, goat, bison,
horse, wolf, boar, monkey, badger, antelope, fishes, and
birds, and also the representations of some plants. In the
lowest layer of the soil the most perfect works occur, and
they grow less as the surface is approached. Several of those
implements called "batons of command" occurred, ornamented
with animals' heads. On the rib of a horse was
carved an antelope, and on the bone of a bird various
figures&mdash;plants, reindeer, and a fish. This cave was made
the subject of a report by M. Piette before the Paris Anthropological
Society.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<span class="smcap">The Fossil Man of Mentone.</span></span>
</div>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
The fossil man of Mentone, found in a grotto of Mentone,
a village near Nice, for some time past has produced much
comment among scientists. The skeleton was discovered in
undisturbed earth; at a depth of twenty-one feet. The cause
of the discussion is that the skeleton is accompanied by a
multiplicity of bone-tools, needles, chisels, a baton of command,
a necklace, various species of the deer, indicating the
reindeer epoch, but surrounded also by the remains of the
cave-bear, cave-hyena, and woolly-haired rhinoceros. Dr.
Garrigou arrives at the conclusion that this cave was first
inhabited by men of the preceding epoch, or inter-glacial,
and during the reindeer epoch was used as a place of burial.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
The attitude of the skeleton was that of repose (see Fig. 14).
It was stained by oxide of iron. The tibi&aelig;, or shin-bones,
present a noticeable feature by being more flattened than in
the European of the present time.</p>

<p>In the same neighborhood there have more recently been
discovered, in different caves, four other human skeletons.
They were all stained with oxide of iron, and two of them
surrounded with pierced sea-shells, teeth of the stag, constituting
the remains of necklaces and bracelets. With one
skeleton, which belonged to a large individual, were discovered
implements of stone and bone, tooth of a cave-bear,
bones of other animals, and shells of edible marine mollusks.
The other two skeletons were those of children, and not
accompanied by either implements or ornaments.</p>

<p>The other bone caves of France, which have afforded
much valuable information, and belonging to this epoch, are:
La Gorge d'Enfer, Liveyre, Pey de l'Aze, Combe-Granal, Le
Moustier and Badegoule (Dordogne), cave of Bize (Aude),
cave of La Vache (Ari&eacute;ge), cave of Savign&eacute; (Vienne), grottos
of La Balme and Bethenas, in Dauphin&eacute;, the settlement of
Solutr&eacute;, the cave of Lourdes (Hautes-Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es), and the cave
of Espalungue (Basses-Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es)&mdash;the last two date back to
the most ancient period of the reindeer epoch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>The principal objects found in these caves, and the rock-shelters
are worked flakes, scrapers, cores, awls, lance-heads,
cutters, hammers, and mortar-stones. These works, though
unpolished, are but little ruder than those of the Esquimaux
or the North American Indian.</p>

<p><i>Belgian Caverns.</i>&mdash;Under the auspices of the Belgian
government M. Edward Dupont examined more than twenty
caves on the banks of the Lesse, in the province of Namur.
Among these were four, in which occurred numerous traces
of the reindeer-man, namely, Trou du Frontal, Trou Rosette,
Trou des Nutons, and Trou de Chaleux.</p>

<p>The cavern Trou de Frontal was a place of burial, and
similar to the cave of Aurignac. The mouth of the cave was
closed by a slab of sandstone, and within were the remains of
fourteen human beings belonging to persons of various ages,
and some of them to infants scarcely a year old. In front of
the cave was an esplanade, where were celebrated the funeral
feasts, and which was marked by hearth-stone, traces of fire,
flint-knives, bones of animals, shells, etc. The human bones
were intermixed with a considerable number of the bones of
the reindeer and other animals, as well as the different kinds
of implements. Among the remains were two perfect human
skulls, in a good state of preservation. The bones were discovered
in a state of great confusion, which M. Dupont
thinks was caused by the disturbance of water. Sir John
Lubbock regards the disturbance of the bones as due to foxes
and badgers.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Immediately above this cave is the Trou Rosette, in which
the bones of three persons were found, mingled with those of
the reindeer and beaver. It also contained fragments of a
blackish kind of pottery, which were hollowed out in rough
grooves and hardened by fire. Dupont is of opinion that the
three men were crushed to death by masses of rock at the
time of the inundation of the valley of the Lesse.</p>

<p>In the Trou des Nutons, situated one hundred and sixty-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>four
feet above the Lesse, were found a great many bones of
the reindeer, wild bull, and many other species. In the cave,
indiscriminately mixed up with these bones, were one hundred
and fifty worked reindeer horns, knuckle-bones of the goat,
polished on both sides, a whistle made from the tibia of a
goat, fragments of very coarse pottery, and fire-hearths.</p>

</div>


<p>The cave of Chaleux was buried by a mass of rubbish
caused by the falling in of the roof, consequently preserving
all its implements. There were found the split bones of
mammals and the bones of birds and fishes. There was an
immense number of objects, chiefly manufactured from reindeer
horn, such as needles, arrow-heads, daggers, and hooks.
Besides these, there were ornaments made of shells, pieces of
slate with engraved figure, mathematical lines, remains of
very coarse pottery, hearth-stones, ashes, charcoal, and last
but not least, thirty thousand worked flints mingled with the
broken bones. In the hearth, placed in the centre of the
cave, was discovered a stone, with certain but unintelligible
signs engraved upon it. M. Dupont also found about twenty
pounds of the bones of the water-rat, either scorched or
roasted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>In a cave at Furfooz, Dupont found an urn, or specimen
of rough pottery (Fig. 15) intermingled with human bones.
It was partly broken; by the care of M. Hauzeur it has been
put together again.</p>

<p>France and Belgium are not alone in their monuments of
the reindeer epoch, for settlements of this epoch have been
discovered in Germany, Switzerland, and Poland.</p>

<p>In the cave of Thayngen, near Schaffhausen, Switzerland,
have been discovered a few remains of the mammoth,
rhinoceros, and cave-lion; the remains of two hundred and
fifty reindeer, four hundred and thirty Alpine hares; also
the remains of the brown bear, stag, elk, auroch, glutton,
wolf, and several kinds of fox. The large bones invariably
appeared in fragments, and the pebbles used for breaking
them were found in the refuse. Among birds, the bones of
the swan, grouse, and duck predominate. The implements
consisted chiefly of needles, piercers, and arrow-heads made of
the antlers of the reindeer. The art of engraving and
carving was carried to quite a degree of perfection. The
most notable of these objects is the delineation of a reindeer
in the act of browsing, drawn on a piece of the horn of that
animal.</p>

<p>Not far from Cracow (Poland), a cavern has been recently
discovered and examined by Count Zawisza. In the upper
part of the floor (four feet in depth), consisting of vegetable
earth, mould, and <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, occurred ashes, flint implements,
and the split bones of the cave-bear, reindeer, horse, elk, and
other animals. Beneath this layer appeared the broken bones
of the mammoth, an ornament of ivory, and the perforated
teeth of the cave-bear, stag, elk, wolf, and fox. Two
thousand flint implements were obtained; and from the
frequent occurrence of flint the cave was used by the troglodytes,
or cave-men, as a dwelling; and by the remains of the
fauna, it must have been occupied during the inter-glacial,
and at the beginning of the reindeer epoch.</p>

<h3>MAN OF THE REINDEER EPOCH.</h3>


<p>The Reindeer Epoch, approaching nearer the present age
than those already enumerated, presents man under a more
favorable aspect, and affords a better view of his traits of
character and manner of living. Not only the sturdy climate
spurs him to action, but a higher type is supplanting
the original savages. The brachycephalic, or round-headed,
has penetrated the recesses of that wild country and brought
with him the art of making more perfect implements. This
new type was of short stature, having small hands and feet.
If Asia be the home of man, then from that country,
advanced in civilization, came the vanguard who were
destined to supplant their predecessors, tame the wild beasts,
and conquer the forests. Representatives of this type are
found in the Lapps and Fins. Between the two existing
races&mdash;dolichocephalic and brachycephalic&mdash;there may have
been a long and bitter strife. The former was large, stout,
fearless, and cruel; the latter, small, hardy, and more intelligent.
It was a conflict between brute force and intelligence.
The more perfect weapons must have told fearfully
against the rude axes and arrows of the dolichocephalic. It
could not have been a war of extermination, for finally an
intermixture took place, producing a medium, as may be
judged from the exhumed skulls.</p>

<p><i>Dwellings.</i>&mdash;As in the past ages, man continued to dwell,
for the most part, in caves. If the cave was small, he occupied
every portion; but if large, only that part near the
opening was used. In the centre of this dwelling he made a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
hearth, out of stones sunk in the floor, and with the fire
placed upon it, he cooked his meals and warmed his body.
This mode of life did not always satisfy him, for he ventured
out, and under the projection of an overhanging rock he built
him a booth, or rude hut, out of boughs, and the poles of
fallen timber. These dwellings, whether in caves or under
the rocks, were near some stream.</p>

<p><i>Clothing.</i>&mdash;The climate being cold, he probably ceased to
use the inner bark of trees, and depended solely on the skins
of animals. The skins were prepared by the flint scrapers,
and then rendered supple by rubbing into them the brains
and the marrow extracted from the skulls and long bones of
the reindeer. These garments may have been artistically
shaped, for they understood the art of sewing. With the
bodkin they pierced the skin, and with the needle, end was
held to end and side to side, and the same made permanent
by the sinew of some animal.</p>

<p><i>Food.</i>&mdash;These people were essentially hunters, and lived
principally upon the reindeer, which they attacked with their
spears and arrows. The horse, elk, ox, ibex, and the
chamois, formed a considerable part of their food. The meat
was cooked on the rough hearths, and the skull and the long
bones were split open in order to extract the brains and
marrow, which formed a delicious dish. To this they also
added fish and, occasionally, certain birds, such as the heath-cock,
swan, and owl. The chase did not always afford them
sufficient food, and at times they were forced to subsist on
the water-rat.</p>

<p>Enough evidence has been produced to show that these
people were cannibals. Human finger-joints were discovered
among the remains of cooking at Solutr&eacute; in M&acirc;connais. M.
Issel found, at a point on the road from Genoa to Nice, some
human bones which had been calcined, and were of a whitish
color, light, and friable. The incrustations on their surface
still contained small fragments of carbon, and some of them
showed notches made by some sharp instrument. In one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the grottos of Northern Italy M. Costa de Beauregard found
the small shin-bone of a child, which had been carefully
emptied and cleansed. Professor Owen thinks he can recognize
the trace of human teeth on some human skulls and
children's bones found in Scotland, and promiscuously mixed
with sculptured flints and the remains of pottery.</p>

<p><i>The Arts.</i>&mdash;Man had not yet discovered the value of
metal, but formed his instruments out of flint, bone, and the
horn of the reindeer. The hatchet was but little used, and
the principal weapons were the flint-knife, arrow-heads, and
occasionally the lower jaw-bone of the cave-bear, with its
pointed canine tooth. The articles of domestic use were
rough pottery, knives, scrapers, saws, bodkins, needles, and
other wrought implements. He had articles for ornamenting
his person and pleasing his fancy, such as shells for beads,
and the whistle for delighting his ear. The art of engraving
was practised to a great extent, and so admirably did he
execute his designs that, after the lapse of thousands of years,
the figures are easily recognized.</p>

<p>The staff of authority would imply that there were
certain individuals who were recognized as chiefs or leaders.
Some system must have prevailed, for without it the manufactories
at Laugeri&egrave;-Basse and Laugerie-Haute could not
have been carried on. In the first of these workshops the
fabrications were almost wholly spear-heads, and in the second
reindeer horn was used for the weapons and implements.</p>

<p><i>Traffic.</i>&mdash;Commerce was begun. The inhabitants of Belgium
sought their flints in that part of France now called
Champagne. From the same locality they also brought back
fossil shells, which were strung together and used for necklaces.
There can be no doubt of this, as already fifty-four of
these shells have been found at Chaleux, and they are not
found naturally anywhere else than in Champagne.</p>

<p><i>Burial.</i>&mdash;As in the previous epoch, the dead were consigned
to the same kind of caves as were used for habitations,
and the entombment was celebrated by the funeral-feast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
These banquets afford no evidence of worship. Some have
thought they not only saw signs of worship in the banquets,
but also in some of the carvings. No idols have been found.
That they should have no notion of a future state is not
surprising, for Sir J. Lubbock has shown that there are
tribes at the present time without this belief.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>M. Edward Dupont, in his report to the Belgian minister
of the Interior, on the excavations carried on in the caves, has
concisely but eloquently given a synopsis of man of the
reindeer epoch, in the following language:</p>

<p>"The data obtained from the fossils of Chaleux, together
with those which have been met with in the caves of Furfooz,
present us with a striking picture of the primitive ages of
mankind in Belgium. These ancient tribes, and all their
customs, after having been buried in oblivion for thousands
and thousands of years, are again vividly brought before our
eyes; and, ... antiquity lives again in the relics of its
former existence.</p>

<p>"We may almost fancy that we can see them in their dark
and subterranean retreats, crouching round their hearths,
and skilfully and patiently chipping out their flint instruments
and shaping their reindeer-horn tools, in the midst of all
the pestilential emanations arising from the various animal remains
which their carelessness has allowed to remain in their
dwellings. Skins of wild beasts are stripped of their hair,
and, by the aid of flint needles, are converted into garments.
In our mind's eye, we may see them engaged in the chase,
and hunting wild animals&mdash;their only weapons being darts
and spears, the fatal points of which are formed of nothing
but a splinter of flint. Again, we are present at their feasts,
in which, during the period when their hunting has been
fortunate, a horse, a bear, or a reindeer, becomes the more
noble substitute for the tainted flesh of the rat, their sole
resource in the time of famine.</p>

<p>"Now, we see them trafficking with the tribes inhabiting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the region now called France, and procuring the jet and fossil
shells with which they love to adorn themselves, and the flint
which is to them so precious a material. On one side they
are picking up the fluor spar, the color of which is pleasing
to their eyes; on the other, they are digging out the great
slabs of sandstone which are to be placed as hearth-stones
round their fire.</p>

<p>"But, alas! inauspicious days arrive." The roof of their
principal cave falls in, burying their weapons and utensils,
and forcing them "to fly and take up their abode in another
spot. The ravages of death break in upon them....
They bear the corpse into its cavernous sepulchre; some
weapons, an amulet, and perhaps an urn, form the whole of
the funeral furniture. A slab of stone prevents the inroad of
wild beasts. Then begins the funeral banquet, celebrated
close by the abode of the dead; a fire is lighted, great animals
are cut up, and portions of their smoking flesh are
distributed to each. How strange the ceremonies that must
then have taken place! ceremonies like those told us of the
savages of the Indian and African solitudes. Imagination
may easily depict the songs, the dances, and the invocations,
but science is powerless to call them into life....</p>

<p>"But the end of this primitive age is at last come.
Torrents of water break in upon the country. Its inhabitants,
driven from their abodes, in vain take refuge on
the lofty mountain summits. Death at last overtakes them,
and a dark cavern is the tomb of the wretched beings, who,
at Furfooz, were witnesses of this immense catastrophe."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<h3>NEOLITHIC EPOCH.</h3>


<p>The Neolithic, or Epoch of Tamed Animals, is characterized
by stone implements, polished or made smooth by a
process of grinding and cutting, the greater development
attained in the art of pottery, and by the presence of the
bones of the domesticated animals. This age, in which no
remains of the reindeer occur, immediately follows the reindeer
epoch, and to it are referred in general all discoveries
made in the so called <i>alluvial</i> soil, the most ancient remains
of the so called Celts, the shell-heaps of Denmark, the
tumuli or grave-mounds, the dolmens, the earlier Swiss
pile-buildings, the Irish lake-dwellings, and some of the caves
of France.</p>

<p><i>Caverns.</i>&mdash;The caves belonging to this period, and explored
by MM. Garrigou and Filhol, are those of the
Pyrenees and the caves of Pradi&eacute;rs, Bedeilhac, Labart, Niaux,
Ussat, and Fontanel. Some of these caverns have been used
in earlier ages, as is shown by the remains of extinct mammals.
The upper crust of the floors of the caves belong to
this period, and in them are found the bones of the ox, stag,
sheep, goat, antelope, chamois, wild boar, wolf, dog, fox,
badger, hare, and horse, intermingled with the remains of
hearths, also piercers, spear-heads, and arrow-heads, made of
bone; hatchets, knives, scrapers made of flints, and various
other substances, such as silicious schist, quartzite, leptinite,
and serpentine stone. These implements were carefully
wrought, and mostly polished.</p>

<p>The cave of Saint Jean d'Alcas (Aveyron), explored at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
different times by M. Cazalis de Fondace, was used as a
place of sepulture. It was first examined about twenty-five
years ago, and at that time five human skulls, in a good state
of preservation, were found, but have been lost, as their importance
was not then known. Intermingled with these
bones were flint, jade, and serpentine implements, carved
bones, remains of rough pottery, stone amulets, and the shells
of shell-fish, but no remains of funeral banquets. At the
mouth of the cave were two large flag-stones lying across one
another. The most recent discoveries in the cave have
furnished metallic substances, which would place it, as a
habitation, to the last of the neolithic.</p>

<p><i>Danish Kj&ouml;kken-M&ouml;ddings, or Shell-Mounds, or kitchen-refuse
heaps.</i>&mdash;The refuse heaps of Denmark were carefully
examined by Professors Steenstrup, the naturalist, Forchammer,
a geologist, and Worsaae, the arch&aelig;ologist, commissioned
by the Danish government, their reports being
presented to the Academy of Sciences at Copenhagen.</p>

<p>They are found chiefly on the north coast of Denmark,
and consist of the shells of edible mollusks, such as the oyster,
cockle, mussel, and periwinkle. These deposits are from
three to ten feet in thickness, from one hundred to two
hundred and fifty feet in width, and sometimes as much as
one thousand feet in length. In them are found weapons
and other instruments of stone, horn, and bone; fragments
of rough pottery, stone-wedges, knives, etc., in great abundance,
accompanied with charcoal and ashes; no traces of
coin, bronze, or iron, or domestic animals, except the dog.
The bones of animals are very numerous, but no human
bones have ever been discovered. Professor Steenstrup
estimates that ninety-seven per cent. of the bones belong to
the stag, the roe-deer, and the wild boar. The other remains
are those of the urus (<i>Bos primigenius</i>), dog, fox, wolf, marten,
wild-cat, hedgehog, bear (<i>Ursus arctos</i>), and the mouse,
and the bones of birds and fishes. The auroch, musk ox,
domestic ox, elk, hare, sheep, and domestic hog are absent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>The mollusca of these shell-mounds are of a size which
are never obtained by the representatives of the same species
now living on the Baltic. They are not more than one-half
or even one-third the size. At the time of the formation of
these mounds, the Baltic was a true sea, or an arm of the
ocean, and these mollusks were taken from it. Now the
Baltic has not the character of a true sea, but is merely
brackish, and the oyster does not occur in the Baltic except
at its entrance into the ocean.</p>

<p>These deposits have been found several miles inland,
which would indicate that the sea had once covered the
intervening space. On the western coast they have not been
found, in consequence of their having possibly been swept
away by the encroachments of the sea. They are also found
on the adjacent islands.</p>

<p>These mounds are not peculiar alone to Denmark; for
they are found in England, Scotland, France, and America.</p>

<p><i>Danish Peat Bogs.</i>&mdash;The peat bogs of Denmark, so faithfully
investigated by Professor Steenstrup, mark three periods
of deposition. The most ancient is called the <i>Scotch-Fir</i>;
the second, immediately above, the <i>Oak</i>, and the uppermost,
the <i>Beech</i>. The peat is from ten to forty feet in thickness,
and to form a layer from ten to twenty feet thick would
require, according to Steenstrup, <i>at least</i> four thousand years,
and perhaps even from three to four times that period.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
These three epochs denote three periods of time. The lowest
belongs to the neolithic, the middle to the bronze, and
the last to the iron epoch. In the lowest, or <i>Fir</i> period,
have been found worked flints and bones. Human bones
have been found, which correspond with the bones taken
from the tumuli of this epoch.</p>

<p><i>The Lake-Dwellings of Switzerland.</i>&mdash;Dr. Ferdinand
Keller and his associates have made known to the world the
wonderful remains of villages situated in the lakes of Switzerland
and other countries. The villages of Switzerland do not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
all belong to the same period, and they represent the neolithic,
bronze, and iron epochs; but there was no hard line
of demarcation between these three periods. These habitations
are so numerous that more than two hundred settlements
hare been discovered in Switzerland alone. Among
the lakes furnishing these remains may be counted the Lake
of Neuch&acirc;tel (forty-six settlements); Lake Constance (thirty-two
settlements); Lake of Geneva (twenty-four settlements);
Lake of Bienne (twenty-one settlements); Lake of Morat
(sixteen settlements); Lake of Zurich (three settlements);
Lake of Pf&aelig;ffikon (six settlements); Lake of Sempach (six
settlements); Lake of Moosseedorf (two settlements); Lake
of Inkwyl (one settlement); Lake of Nussbaumen (one settlement);
Lake Greiffensee (one settlement); Lake of Zug
(six settlements); Lake of Baldegg (five settlements), and
others.</p>

<p>The habitations belonging to the neolithic are Lake Constance
thirty, Neuchatel twelve, Geneva two settlements; one
each at Morat, Bienne, Zurick, Pf&aelig;ffikon, Inkwyl, Moosseedorf,
Nussbaumen, the settlement of Concise, the bridge
Thi&eacute;le, the peat-bog of Wauwyl, and others.</p>

<p>These dwellings were built near the shore, on piles of
various kinds of wood, sharpened by tools and fire, and
driven into the mud at the shallow bottom of the lake. In
some of the settlements the piles were fastened by heaping
stones around them. The piles were sometimes placed
together, at others apart. The heads were brought to a level
and then the platform beams were fastened upon them.
This basis served for the foundation of the rude rectangular
huts they erected. These piles are not now seen above the
water, yet they are visible above the bottom of the lake.
The number of piles in some of these settlements is as high
as one hundred thousand, and the area occupied, not less than
seventy thousand square yards. It has been estimated that
the population of the Lake-villages during the neolithic was
over thirty thousand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>The object of these dwellings was to protect the inhabitants
from wild animals, the attacks of enemies, and for the
ready obtaining of food by fishing. They were not only
occupied by the inhabitants, but also by their herds and the
stores of fodder.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p><i>Robenhausen.</i>&mdash;It is not necessary to go into an account
of a number of these settlements to represent the neolithic
epoch, for the settlement at Robenhausen (Lake Pf&aelig;ffikon)
takes the first rank in giving the domestic arrangements of
the ancient inhabitants. This settlement covered a space of
nearly three acres, and one hundred thousand piles were used
in the whole structure. Its form was an irregular quadrangle.
It was about two thousand paces from the ancient
western shore of the lake, and about three thousand from the
shore in the opposite direction. With the last-named side
there was a communication by means of a bridge, the piles of
which are still visible. On this side were the gardens and
pastures. The dwellers of this settlement were unfortunate,
as their habitation was twice burned up, and each time, they
rallied and rebuilt their huts. They remained a long time as
would seem from the depth of the peat and the vast amount
of relics found.</p>

<p>At a depth of eleven feet were found the earliest or most
ancient relics; at ten and one-half feet, the remains of the
first conflagration&mdash;charcoal, stone and bone implements,
pottery, woven cloth, corn, apples, etc.; at seven and one-half
feet, flooring, relics of the second settlement, and
excrement of cows, sheep, and goats; at six and one half
feet, remains of second conflagration&mdash;charcoal, stone and
bone implements, pottery, woven cloth, corn, apples, etc.; at
three and one-half feet, broken stones, flooring, and relics of
the third settlement; at two and one half feet, stone celts,
pottery, but no traces of fire. Above this was two feet of
peat and one-half foot of mould.</p>

<p>Without going into detail, the objects found in these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
various beds are as follows: Made out of wood, are knives,
ladles, plates, clubs of ash, in which is fixed a socket of stag's
horn containing a stone celt, a boat made of a single trunk,
twelve feet long, two and one-half feet wide, and five inches
deep, flails for threshing out grain, bows notched at both
ends, fishing implements, floats for the support of nets, suspension
hooks, tubs, chisels, sandals, yokes made for carrying
vessels, and a peculiar ornament. These implements were all
made out of yew, maple, ash, fir, and the root of the hazel
bush. Out of stag's horn&mdash;arrow-heads, daggers, piercing
and scraping tools, implements for knitting and for agriculture.
The implements of stone were polished, and of the
usual form. The objects of clay were fragments of pottery, in
the shape of urns, plates, and cups, in great abundance.
There were also found spoons, and a perforated cone, supposed
to have been used as a weight for the loom. Several
crucibles or melting pots have been found, which were used
for melting copper. The third building of this village was
on the borderland between the stone and bronze ages.</p>

<p>The remains of animals found here and at Moosseedorf
and Wauwyl, all of the neolithic, belong to the brown bear,
badger, marten, pine-marten, polecat, wolf, fox, wild-cat,
beaver, elk, urus, bison, stag, roe-deer, wild-boar, marsh-boar;
the domestic animals were the boar, horse, ox, goat, sheep,
and dog. The remains of the domestic hog are absent from
all the pile works of this period, save the one at Wauwyl.</p>

<p>Among cereals (Robenhausen) were found several varieties
of wheat and barley; fruits and berries&mdash;service-tree, dog-rose,
elder, bilberry, and wayfaring tree; the nuts&mdash;hazel,
beech, and water-chestnut; the oil-producing plants&mdash;opium,
or garden poppy, and dogwood; the fibrous plants&mdash;flax;
plants used for dying&mdash;weld; forest trees and shrubs&mdash;silver
fir, juniper, yew, ash, and oak; water and marsh plants&mdash;lake
scirpus, pondweeds, common hornwort, marsh bedstraw,
buckbean, yellow waterlily, ivy-leaved crowfoot, and marsh
pennywort.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<p>Besides these there have been found many specimens of
plaited and woven cloth; also ropes, cords, and a portion of
a linseed cake.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>In the different settlements the same axes and knives
abound, and are of small size. The arrow-heads and saws
are an improvement on those of the preceding epoch.
Among domestic implements, spindle-whorls of rude earthenware
were abundant in some of the villages, and corn-crushers
are occasionally met with from two to three inches in diameter.
About five hundred implements of stone have been
found at Wauwyl, consisting of axes, small flint arrow-heads,
flint-flakes, corn-crushers, rude stones used as hammers,
whetstones, and sling-stones.</p>

<p>As these Lake-Dwellings not only belong to the last of
the neolithic, but extend beyond, they naturally have a place
in the close of this period. M. Troyon says the dwellings of
this period came suddenly to an "end by the irruption of a
people provided with bronze implements. The lake-dwellings
were burned by these new-comers, and the primitive
inhabitants were slaughtered or driven back into remote
places. This catastrophe affects chiefly the settlements of
East Switzerland, which entirely disappeared, and also a
number of those on the shore of the western lakes. Some few
settlements, however&mdash;namely, those of the so-called transition
period&mdash;are said not to have been destroyed by the new
people till after the inhabitants had begun to make use of
bronze implements."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Keller takes exception to these views. He says there
is no sudden leap from one class of civilization to another,
and that the metals came gradually into use. The lake-dwellings
were not burned down by the irruption of a foreign
people; for at Niederwyl, and several settlements of the
Unter-See, no traces of fire have been observed. The fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
that but a very few human skeletons have been found in the
whole settlements, contradicts the supposition of a battle
having taken place between the aborigines and the supposed
conquerors, and of the destruction of the former by the
latter.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>Lake-dwellings belonging to this age and the bronze, have
been found in Bavaria, Northern Italy, Mecklenburg, Pomerania,
France, England, Scotland, and Ireland. Herodotus
says that the P&aelig;onians lived this way in Lake Prasias
(Thrace), and Lubbock says that the fishermen of Lake
Prasias still inhabit wooden huts built over the water. The
town of Tcherkask in Russia, is constructed over the river

<p>Several attempts have been made to estimate the time
which has elapsed since the neolithic period. The estimates
of M. Morlot are based on the discoveries made in a hillock
formed by the river Tini&egrave;re at its entrance into the lake of
Geneva. This cone contained three distinct layers of vegetable
earth placed at different depths between the deposits of
alluvium. The first was at a depth of three and one-half feet
from the top, and was from four to six inches thick, and in
it were found relics of the Roman period; the second was
five and one-fourth feet lower, and six inches thick, in which
were fragments of bronze; the third was at a depth of eighteen
feet from the top, and varied in thickness from six to
seven inches, and contained fragments of the stone age.
History proves that the layer containing the Roman relics is
from thirteen to eighteen centuries old. Since that epoch
the cone has increased three and one-half feet, and if the
increase was the same in previous ages, then the bed containing
the bronze is from twenty-nine hundred to forty-two
hundred years old, and the lowest layer, belonging to the
stone age, is from four thousand seven hundred to ten
thousand years old.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>The calculation by M. Gillieron was made from the
discoveries near the bridge of Thi&egrave;le. About one thousand
two hundred and thirty feet from the present shore is the old
abbey of Saint Jean, built in the year 1100. There is a
document which seems to show that the abbey was built on
the edge of the lake. Then, in seven hundred and fifty years
the lake retired one thousand two hundred and thirty feet.
The distance of the present shore from the settlement of the
bridge of Thi&egrave;le is eleven thousand and seventy-two feet, and
consequently the settlement is not less than six thousand
seven hundred and fifty years old.</p>

<p>M. Figuier assigns to the lake-dwellings an antiquity of
from six to seven thousand years before the Christian era.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<h3>MAN OF THE NEOLITHIC.</h3>


<p>From the human bones found in peat-bogs and tumuli,
man is represented as having a narrow but round skull,
with a projecting ridge above the eyebrows, showing he was
round-headed, his eyebrows overhanging, small of stature
though stout, and having a great resemblance to the Laplanders.
In many respects the race was much superior to
that of the preceding epoch. Man advanced rapidly in the
arts, and made great progress in civilization. He had passed
out of the barbarous, and might be called a semi-barbarian.</p>

<p><i>Habitations.</i>&mdash;Man's habitation varied according to the
locality. In the extreme south of France he continued for a
considerable length of time to occupy the caves and rock-shelters;
in Switzerland, the pile-buildings, and in Denmark
he undoubtedly had rude huts placed close together and in
proximity to the shell-heaps.</p>

<p><i>Clothing.</i>&mdash;Clothing also varied according to locality.
Where the wild animals were numerous their skins were
used&mdash;there being no incentive to substitute other material.
Coarse material made of fibrous plants had come into use.
The lake-dwellers clothed themselves with this material, and
completely protected their bodies. They also used sandals for
their feet, as these have been found with the usual indications
of usage.</p>

<p><i>Food.</i>&mdash;Where wild animals could be obtained they were
used, and the marrow of the long bones extracted. To this,
fish and birds were added. In Denmark the principal food
was the different species of the edible mollusk. In Switzer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>land
a higher order and greater variety of food was used.
The meat of the wild animals, birds, and fish was varied
with bread made of barley and wheat, and fruit and berries.
The meat was not only obtained from the wild animal, but
they provided against the uncertainty of the chase by domesticating
the boar, ox, sheep, and goat. The horse and dog
were domesticated to assist in the chase, but sometimes
served for food, probably during a famine.</p>

<p>If these people were cannibals, the evidence must rest
solely on the human bones discovered at a dolmen near the
village of Hammer, Denmark, which had been subjected to
the action of fire. They were found together with some flint
implements. But this evidence is not sufficient to lead to the
conclusion that at the funeral banquets human flesh was used
along with the roasted stag.</p>

<p><i>Arts and Manufactures.</i>&mdash;The flint hatchets of the refuse-heaps
are generally of an imperfect type; the long knives
indicate a considerable amount of skill; the bodkins, spear-heads,
and scrapers are but little improved. In the latter
part of this epoch, the various kinds of implements, especially
in Switzerland, attained to a surprising degree of perfection,
in so much so, it is difficult to understand how this was
achieved without the use of metal. They were made into
various shapes, and with the design of pleasing the eye.</p>

<p>Besides the various types of implements common to the
different countries, the tribes of Denmark manufactured a
drilled hatchet, which is combined in various ways with the
hammer. A specimen of this type is represented in Fig. 16,
now in the Museum of Copenhagen. It is pierced with a
round hole, in which the handle was fixed. The cutting edge
describes an arc of a circle, and the other end is wrought
into sharp angular edges.</p>

<p>New inventions were brought into use. Among them was
a comb which, according to shape, might be compared to the
dung-fork of the American stables. Ornaments for the body,
made of various materials were fashioned. Pottery was still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
in a rough state, though gradually improving. The loom was
invented, and various kinds of cloth were manufactured.
Also out of the fibrous plants cordage was made, which again
was fashioned into nets for fishing. Many canoes at various
places have been found, showing that they were not only used
for fishing but also for carrying cargoes. Workshops were
established, and there the stone implements were made and
polished; one of these shops was at Pressigny.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Danish Axe-Hammer, Drilled for Handle.</span></span>
</div>



<p>Some idea may be had of the vast number of stone implements
which occur, when it is considered that in the Museum
of Copenhagen there are about twelve thousand, consisting of
flint axes, wedges, broad, narrow, and hollow chisels; poniards,
lance-heads, arrow-heads, flint flakes, and half-moon-shaped
implements. In other collections in Denmark there
are twenty thousand implements. The museum at Stockholm
contains about sixteen thousand, and the Royal Irish
Academy owns seven hundred flint-flakes, five hundred and
twelve celts, more than four hundred arrow-heads, fifty spear-heads,
seventy-five scrapers, and numerous other objects of
stone, such as sling-stones, hammers, whetstones, grain-crushers,
etc.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Some of these implements, however, may
belong to other epochs.</p>

<p>War must have been carried on to a considerable extent,
as fortified camps have been discovered in Belgium, at Furfooz,
and other places. Their weapons were the axe, the
arrow, the spear, and possibly the knife. These were wrought
with great care.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;Man commenced to till the ground in this
age, and thus laid the true foundation of civilization. He
probably was forced to do it. The beasts of the forest were
gradually decreasing. They had nourished him in the
infancy of his mind, and now he should begin to look to the
soil, and by the cultivation of its products he must sustain his
life. His principal implement of agriculture must have been
the sharpened stick, pointed with deer-horn. He cultivated
the cereals, made his corn-mill, and stored the grain for
winter use.</p>

<p><i>Burial.</i>&mdash;How the colonists of the lake-dwellings disposed
of their dead is unknown. In Denmark, and many other
places, the dead were buried in dolmens or tumuli. A dolmen
is a monument consisting of several perpendicular stones
covered with a great block or slab. When it is surrounded
by circles of stone it takes the name <i>cromlech</i>. The dolmens
occur also in Scandinavia, France, and Brittany. They
were formerly considered to have been Druidical sacrificial
altars. They were usually covered over with earth, and in
them were buried from one to twenty persons, accompanied
with their implements. When a person died, the tomb was
reopened to receive the new occupant. At such a time fire
was used for the purpose of purifying the atmosphere of the
tomb. In Brittany, in the vicinity of the tombs, there
were set up in the ground enormous blocks of stone, that
have received the name of <i>menhirs</i>, the most noted of which
is that at Carnac. When these dolmens remain in the state
in which they were left, still covered with earth, they take
the name of <i>tumuli</i>. Comparatively few of the tumuli
belong to the neolithic. In these, large numbers of bodies
have been found, and none of them in a natural position, but
cramped up and their heads resting between the knees.</p>

<p>Judging from the calcined bones, which are frequently
met with at the tomb, it may be inferred that victims were
offered during the funeral ceremonies, perchance a slave, or
the widow. Lubbock is of opinion that when a woman died<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
in giving birth to a child, or even while still suckling it, the
child was interred alive with her.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>This hypothesis is substantiated by the great number of
cases in which the skeleton of a woman and child have been
found together. In the ceremonies at the tomb, some read
the belief in a future state of existence. The evidence, however,
is no clearer than that in the previous epochs. Man
undoubtedly had such a belief, but science does not reveal it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>BRONZE EPOCH.</h3>


<p>The Age of Bronze bears no direct relation to the antiquity
of man, for it is largely embraced in written history.
Although history does not record the events of the age of
bronze in Western Europe, yet history covers the time which
embraces the use of bronze. This epoch has more to do
with the arch&aelig;ologist than the geologist. It is marked by the
abundance of swords, spears, fish-hooks, sickles, knives,
ornaments, and other articles made of bronze. The bronze
implements are principally found in England, Scotland,
Ireland, France, Denmark, Norway, Italy, and Switzerland.
The lake-settlements of Switzerland known to belong to
this epoch are: Geneva, ten settlements; Neuchatel, twenty-five
settlements; Bienne, ten settlements; Morat, three settlements;
and Sempach, two settlements. To these may be
added some of the crannoges of Ireland; also many tumuli
and mounds.</p>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;The man of this epoch was not unlike that of the
preceding. His head was rather broad than long, he was
small, energetic, and muscular; his hands were small, as is
proven by the remarkably small handles of their swords,
which are too small for a hand of the present day. This
type of man has maintained itself in the north of Switzerland
to the present time.</p>

<p><i>Habitations and Food.</i>&mdash;The caves and rock-shelters gave
way entirely to the rude huts which now protected man. If
they were resorted to, it was only from some peculiar cause or
danger. The food was the same as in the neolithic, with
additions to the cereals.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Clothing.</i>&mdash;The skins of animals were used less than
formerly for clothing. Garments made of other material
have been found, and even the whole dress of a chief. In a
tumulus of Jutland there were found a thick woollen cap, a
coarse woollen cloak (Fig. 17), semicircular in form, scalloped
out round the neck, shaggy in the inside, three feet
four inches long, and wide in proportion; two woollen shawls,
a woollen shirt, woollen leggings, and the remains of a pair of
leather boots. Fibrous plants also contributed to the comfort
of man, and were possibly used for summer wear, and under
garments in winter.</p>

<span class="smcap">Woollen Cloak of the Bronze Epoch, Found in 1861, in
a Tumulus in Jutland.</span></span>
</div>



<p><i>Implements.</i>&mdash;The people of this age made great improvements
in their weapons, tools, and ornaments. They consist
of bronze celts, swords, hammers, knives, hair-pins, small
rings, ear-rings, bracelets, fish-hooks, awls, spiral-wires, lance-heads,
arrow-heads, buttons, needles, various ornaments,
saws, daggers, sickles, and double-pointed pins. There were
also ornaments of gold. Only one implement, a winged celt,
has been found, which bore an inscription.</p>

<p><i>Arts.</i>&mdash;Progress was made in the art of weaving. Solder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>ing
and the moulding of metal were practised; foundries
were established, the remains of which have been discovered
at Devaine and Walflinger in Switzerland; stone moulds
were used, one of which, on trial, produced a hatchet exactly
similar to those which have been collected. The moulds
were usually made out of sand. The crucible used for the
melting of the metal was made out of pottery which was
placed over a hole in the earth filled with burning charcoal;
when the metal was melted, it was poured into the mould.
Pottery took new shapes and was adorned with various
patterns. Glass, which has so long been ascribed to Ph&#339;nician
origin, was invented in the bronze age, for glass beads,
of a blue or green color, have been found in the tombs of this
epoch.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;The cereals attest to the tilling of the soil.
The ground was prepared by the projecting branch of a stem
of the tree, used as a plough. The grain was stored for
winter use, and when required was crushed by being rubbed
between two stones serving as a mortar.</p>

<p><i>Fishing and Navigation.</i>&mdash;There are no distinct traces of
improvement beyond the past epoch, in fishing and navigation,
unless it be in the improved hooks made of bronze.</p>

<p><i>Burial.</i>&mdash;The custom of burning the dead was almost
universal in Denmark, and was more or less practised in
other countries. The ashes and fragments of the bone were
collected and placed either in or under an urn. When
buried, the corpse was usually placed in a contracted position,
but occasionally extended. With the dead were buried their
implements and clothing. The body of the chief discovered
in a tumulus in Jutland, where the clothing was found,
was buried in a coffin nine and two-third feet long, over two
feet in breadth, and covered by a movable lid. The body
was in a good state of preservation, owing to the action on it
of water strongly impregnated with iron. It was wrapped in
the woollen cloak, and again wrapped in an ox's hide.
Buried with it were the shawls, leggings, shirt, boots, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
caps, two small boxes, a bronze razor, comb, a bronze sword
in a wooden sheath, and a long woollen band. In other
coffins have been found swords, knives, brooches, awls, tweezers,
and buttons, all of bronze. In a baby's coffin was found
an amber bead, and a small bronze bracelet.</p>

<p><i>Religious Belief.</i>&mdash;Many crescents, made of stone and
earthenware, have been found which are regarded, by some
arch&aelig;ologists, as religious emblems. Dr. Keller calls them
"moon images," and has devoted a short chapter to their
consideration.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> On the other hand, Lubbock and Carl Vogt
regard them as resting-places for the head at night.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> They
carefully arranged their long hair, and evidently sacrificed
comfort for vanity. They carried a long pin with which to
scratch the head. This kind of a pillow is still used by the
Fuegeans and Abyssinians, who have their hair elaborately
decorated; and in some cases this is never disturbed. If the
people were worshippers the crescent is the only evidence
from arch&aelig;ology. No idols have ever been discovered. That
the people were already worshippers may be learned from the
traditions recorded in history.</p>

<h3>IRON EPOCH.</h3>


<p>As the <i>Iron Epoch</i> fairly establishes civilization, and
belongs almost wholly to the historical epoch, it will be
here briefly noticed, and then dismissed after giving a quotation
from Dr. Keller. The bronze had not only prepared the
way for the iron epoch, but also gave a great impulse to
succeeding ages. The art of metallurgy assumed a new
importance and gave new life to every movement that tended
to the assistance of man. The works of bronze gave way to
those of iron. A knife made of iron is represented in Fig.
18. Knives of this pattern were, however, made of bronze,
and served for the same purpose. The workshops of this age
were so numerous that four hundred of them have been discovered
in one province. The potter's wheel was invented;
money was introduced, and agriculture greatly nourished.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">A Knife of the Iron Epoch.</span></span>
</div>


<p>Some of the Swiss lake-dwellings of Neuchatel and Bienne
belong to this epoch. Dr. Keller, in summing up some of his
observations, has made use of the following language: "The
phenomenon of the lake-dwellings, so important in the history
of civilization, the time of their first establishment, their
original design, their development, and their final extinction,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
in spite of many accumulated facts, is in many respects
clouded in doubt.... It is certain from the very beginning
of this peculiar mode of living to the latest period of its
existence, while outward circumstances remained the same, a
quiet advance to a better development of the conditions of life
may be observed, in which there was neither retrogression
nor any sudden advance by the intervention of foreign
elements. The general diffusion of metals in a country
which had none, is explained simply by the barter which
existed throughout Europe in the very earliest ages. The
question why the inhabitants of a lake-dwelling of the stone
age abandoned their settlements, while those of another, not
many hours' or many minutes' walk distant, remained quietly
living on their platforms, is of no greater importance than
the inquiry why, during the middle ages, so many localities
have disappeared, the names and situations of which are
known to us. The presence of objects of industry on the
area of the lake-dwellings has nothing in it very surprising, if
we consider what misfortunes villages of straw-covered huts
were exposed to, in which not only the houses themselves,
but even the platforms on which they stood, were formed of
very combustible materials. It is possible, if we are to take
C&aelig;sar's account literally, that when the Helvetii, whose
arrival in the country is neither mentioned in history nor
shown by arch&aelig;ology, withdrew, the lake-dwellings then
existing were, as a whole, burned down; but there can also be
no doubt that some remained standing, or were rebuilt after
the return of the population. Their continuing down to the
Roman time is only astonishing to any one who imagines that
at this time the whole population had gone over to the
Roman manner of life, while the proof lies before him that
the lower class adhered to their own manners and customs
till the entrance of the German races."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<h3>TRACES OF MAN IN AMERICA.</h3>


<p>America furnishes a better field for the antiquary than
the old world. Her ancient remains are not so much injured
by the decay of empires and the rude hand of war. Succeeding
ages have not so much effaced these marks, and many of
the remains still stand as left by the original occupants, save
only the change and decay which time itself produces.
America will yet be discovered. It is true the landmarks are
known; but these have not been investigated so diligently as
the remains of man in Europe. The Boucher de Perthes and
the Dr. Schmerling are yet to come. Until they do, the
history of primitive man in America must be surrounded
with great uncertainty. Much labor has been given to the
investigation of this subject, and many works written, all
looking toward an early development which must sooner or
later come.</p>

<p>In this chapter the aim will only be to point out some of
these traces.</p>

<p><i>Enumeration.</i>&mdash;The implements from the gravel beds of
Colorado and the skull from Calaveras county, California,
have already been referred to (pp. 61, 62).</p>

<p>Near Osage Mission, Kansas, there was found a human
skull imbedded in a solid rock, which was broken open by
blasting. It was examined by Dr. Weirley, who compared
it with a modern skull, and found it resembled the latter in
general shape, yet it was an inch and a quarter longer. Of
this relic he says: "It belonged to a man of a large size, and
was imbedded in conglomerate rock of the tertiary class,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
and found several feet beneath the surface. Parts of the
frontal, parietal, and occipital bones were carried away by
the explosion. The piece of rock holding the remains weighs
some forty or fifty pounds, with many impressions of marine
shells, and through it runs a vein of quartz, or within the
cranium crystallized organic matter, and by the aid of a
microscope presents a beautiful appearance." In shape the
Neanderthal man comes nearest to it.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>In the Comstock lode (Nevada), at a depth of five
hundred feet, Judge A. W. Baldwin found a human skull of
unusual and peculiar shape. It is very short from base to
summit, and exceedingly broad between the ears. The skull
is entire, with the exception of the facial bones. This skull
has never been examined by a competent person.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>In the drift-clay, in the city of Toronto, at a depth of two
feet from the surface, were discovered the bones and horn of
a deer, amidst an accumulation of charcoal and ashes, and
with them a rude stone chisel or hatchet.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>In the gravel of the gold-bearing quartz of the Grinell
leads (Kansas), was found an imperfect flint knife at a depth
of fourteen feet. Above the implement the gravel, composed
of quartz and reddish clay, was ten feet thick, and above this
was four feet of rich black soil. This implement was given
to Dr. Daniel Wilson by Mr. P. A. Scott.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Dickeson found, in the yellow loam of the Mississippi
at Natchez, a human pelvic bone along with the bones of the
mastodon and megalonyx. They were found at a depth of
thirty feet from the surface, and the human bone had the
same black color which characterized the others. Sir
Charles Lyell calculated that it required sixty-seven thousand
years to form the delta of the Mississippi, but admits, if the
conclusions arrived at by the United States engineers be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
correct, in respect to the annual amount of sediment discharged
at the delta, the growth would be reduced to thirty-three
thousand five hundred years. Taking either of these
estimates, the same would give the number of years which
have elapsed since these bones were deposited.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>In an excavation made near New Orleans, at a depth of
sixteen feet from the surface, beneath four cypress forests
superimposed one upon the other, the workmen found a
complete human skeleton, and some charcoal. The cranium
is similar to the aboriginal type of the Indian race. This
discovery furnished the data from which Dr. Bennet Dowler
assigned to the human race an antiquity, in the delta of the
Mississippi, of fifty-seven thousand years.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Count Pourtalis found some fossil human remains, consisting
of jaws, teeth, and some bones of the foot, in a
calcareous conglomerate forming a part of the series of reefs
of Florida. The whole series of reefs is of post-tertiary
origin, and, according to Professor Agassiz, has been one
hundred and thirty-five thousand years in forming. If this
calculation be correct, then these bones must have an
antiquity of ten thousand years.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Lund, a Danish naturalist, explored eight hundred
caverns in Brazil, belonging to different epochs, and exhumed
in them a great number of unknown animal species. In a
calcareous cave, near the lake of Semidouro, he found the
bones of not less than thirty persons of different ages, and
showing a similar state of decomposition to that of the bones
of animals with which they were associated. From the discoveries
there made, Lund was forced to the conclusion that
man was cotemporaneous with the megatherium and the
mylodon&mdash;animals belonging to the post-tertiary.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>The shell-heaps of America are coeval with those of
Denmark. Those at Damariscotta, Maine, have been examined
by Professor W. D. Gunning. He estimates that
within, an area of one hundred rods in length, eighty in
width there are piled one hundred million bushels of oyster
shells. One dome-shaped hillock is nearly one hundred feet
in height. The only human relics found among the shells
are stone gouges, arrow-heads, bone needles, pottery, and
copper knives. These shells were probably deposited by but
a few individuals at a time. When formed, the oyster was a
native of that coast, but within the memory of man the
oyster has not lived there.</p>

<p><i>The Mound-Builders.</i>&mdash;An ancient and unknown people
of a certain degree of civilization have left remains of their
greatness in the fortifications and mounds in the valleys of
the Mississippi and its tributaries. These works extend over
a great extent of territory. They are found in Western
New York, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee,
Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Nebraska,
Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia,
Florida, Texas, and along the Kansas, Platte, and other
western rivers.</p>

<p>The people appear to have originated in Ohio. On
the southern extremity the works gradually lose their distinctive
character, and pass into the higher developed architecture
of Mexico; and at the north, north-east, and north-west, the
population seem to have been more limited and their works
less perfectly developed. The people were pre&euml;minently
given to agriculture; were not warlike, and only navigated
the rivers along their settlements. The fertile valleys of the
Scioto, two Miamis, Kanawaha, White, Wabash, Kentucky,
Cumberland, and Tennessee rivers were densely populated,
as indicated by the numerous works which diversify their
surfaces.</p>

<p>The stone and bone implements from the mounds, in their
shape differ but little from those of Europe. The hatchets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
and knives are not only made of flint but also of obsidian,
and other hard stones. Copper was the chief metallic
substance. Out of this they made various implements, and
swords. It was obtained from the shores of Lake Superior,
where they carried on extensive mining. In these mines
have been found their implements, some of which are very
large diorite hatchets, used as sledges for breaking off lumps
of copper, and so heavy that it would require more than
one man to wield them. The copper was not subjected to
heat, but it was hammered cold into such a shape as was
desired.</p>

<p>Some idea of the number of the mounds and fortresses
may be given from the statement that in the State of Ohio
alone there are from eleven thousand to twelve thousand of
these works. The fortresses were used for the protection of
the people against the predatory warfare of the hostile tribes,
or even, it may be, against the incursions made by other
Mound-Builders. In regard to the mounds, there has been
much speculation, and some arch&aelig;ologists divide them into
sacrificial, sepulchral, temple, and symbolical.</p>

<p><i>Sacrificial.</i>&mdash;The sacrificial mounds are characterized by
"their almost invariable occurrence within enclosures; their
regular construction in uniform layers of gravel, earth, and
sand, disposed alternately in strata conformable to the shape
of the mound; and their covering a symmetrical altar of
burned clay or stone, on which are deposited numerous relics,
in all instances exhibiting traces, more or less abundant, of
their having been exposed to the action of fire."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Among
the most remarkable are those found on the Scioto, at the
place called Mound City situated on the western bank.
The mounds are enclosed by a simple embankment, between
three and four feet high. The area occupied is about thirteen
acres, and includes twenty-four mounds. One of these
is one hundred and forty feet in length, and the greatest
breadth is sixty feet. In this mound occurred four succes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>sive
altars, a bushel of fragments of spear-heads, over fifty
quartz arrow-heads, and copper and other relics. The
sacrificial deposits do not disclose a miscellaneous assemblage
of relics, for on one altar hundreds of sculptured pipes chiefly
occur; on another, pottery, copper ornaments, stone implements;
on others, calcined shells, burned bones; and on
others, no deposit has been noticed. The sacrificial mounds
are found at Marietta and other localities.</p>

<p>All the investigations which have been made prove that
the altars were not only used for a long period, but also had
been repeatedly renewed.</p>

<p><i>Sepulchral.</i>&mdash;The sepulchral mounds are numbered by
the thousands. They are simple earth-pyramids, sometimes
elliptical or pear-shaped, and vary in height from six to
eighty feet. Usually they contain but one skeleton, reduced
almost to ashes, but occasionally in its ordinary condition and
in a crouching position. By the side of them occur trinkets,
and, in a few cases, weapons. These mounds were probably
only raised over the body of a chief or some distinguished
person.</p>

<p><i>Temple.</i>&mdash;The temple mounds are truncated pyramids,
with paths or steps leading to the summit, and sometimes
with terraces at different heights. Among the most noted of
these is that of Cahokia in Illinois. It is seven hundred feet
long at its base, five hundred feet wide, and ninety feet high.
Its level summit is several acres in extent.</p>

<p><i>Symbolical.</i>&mdash;The symbolical mounds consist of gigantic
bas-reliefs formed on the surface of the ground, representing
men, animals, and inanimate objects. In Wisconsin they
exist in thousands, and among the devices are man, the lizard,
turtle, elk, buffalo, bear, fox, otter, raccoon, frog, bird, fish,
cross, crescent, angle, straight-line, war-club, tobacco-pipe,
and other familiar implements or weapons.</p>

<p>In Dane county there is a remarkable group, consisting of
six quadrupeds, six parallelograms, one circular tumulus, one
human figure, and a small circle. The quadrupeds are from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
one hundred to one hundred and twenty feet long, and the
figure of the man measured one hundred and twenty-five feet
in length and nearly one hundred and forty feet from the end
of one arm to the other. Near the village of Pewaukee, when
first discovered there were two lizards and seven tortoises.
One of the latter measured four hundred and seventy feet.</p>

<p>In Adams county, Ohio, is the figure of a vast serpent;
its head occupies the summit of a hill and in its distended
jaws is a part of an oval-shaped mass of earth one hundred and
sixty feet long, eighty wide, and four feet high. The body
of the serpent extends round the hill for about eight hundred
feet, forming graceful coils and undulations. Near Granville,
Licking county, Ohio, on the summit of a hill two hundred
feet high, is the representation of an alligator. Its extreme
length is two hundred and fifty feet, average height four
feet; the head, shoulders, and rump are elevated in parts to
a height of six feet; the paws are forty feet long, the ends
being broader than the links, as if the spread of the toes
were originally indicated. Upon the inner side of the effigy
is a raised space covered with stones which have been exposed
to the action of fire; and from this leading to the top is a
graded way ten feet in breadth. On examination it was
discovered that the outline of the figure was composed of
stones of considerable size, upon which the superstructure had
been modelled in fine clay.</p>

<p><i>Antiquity.</i>&mdash;There are methods of determining the
antiquity of these mounds. Mr. E. G. Squier has pointed
out three facts which go to prove that they belong to a
distant period. 1. None of these ancient works occur on the
lowest formed of the river terraces, which mark the subsidence
of the streams. As these works are raised on all the
others, it follows that the lowest terrace has been formed
since the works were erected. The streams generally form
four terraces, and the period marked by the lowest must be
the longest because the excavating power of such streams
grows less as the channels grow deeper. 2. The skeletons of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the Mound-Builders are found in a condition of extreme
decay. Only one or two skeletons have been recovered in a
condition suitable for intelligent examination. The circumstances
attending their burial were unusually favorable for
preserving them. The earth around them has invariably
been found wonderfully compact and dry; and yet, when
exhumed, they have been in a decomposed and crumbling
condition. 3. Their great age is shown by their relation to
the primeval forests. As the Mound-Builders were a settled
agricultural people, their enclosures and fields were cleared of
trees, and remained so until deserted. When discovered by
the Europeans these enclosures were covered by gigantic
trees, some of them eight hundred years old. The trees
which first made their appearance were not the regular forest
trees. When the first trees that got possession of the soil had
died away, they were supplanted, in many cases, by other
kinds, till at last, after a great number of centuries, that
remarkable diversity of species characteristic of North America
would be established.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Buchner assigns to them an antiquity of from seven
thousand to ten thousand years.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Fort Shelby, in Orleans county, New York, was carefully
examined by Frank H. Cushing, the arch&aelig;ologist. The fort
was found to be composed of two parallel circular walls, with
a gateway in each. The gateway in the outer wall fronted
a peat-bog, the shore of which was some ten feet distant.
Within the enclosure he found small, flat, notched stones, used
for sinking fishing-nets. Into the bog he sank a shaft to the
depth of seven feet, not far from the shore. At the bottom
of the shaft he found the shells of living species of shell-fish.
The natural surroundings show that this fort was built when
the peat-bog was a lake. This is further confirmed by the
fact that all ancient works are erected near a permanent
supply of water. The nearest permanent supply of water is
Oak Orchard Creek, one and one-half mile distant. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
formation of this peat would require not less than four
thousand years, and more probably twice that number.</p>

<p>The Mound-Builders must have remained a very long
time. These works were formed gradually, and the population
extended slowly toward the North. Their corn-fields,
by their raised condition, show many successive years of
usage.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note A.</span>&mdash;In reference to the fossil human bones from Florida
Count L. F. Pourtales says: "The human jaw and other bones,
found in Florida by myself in 1848, were not in a coral formation, but
in a fresh-water sandstone on the shore of Lake Monroe, associated
with fresh-water shells of species still living in the lake, (<i>Paludina,
Ampullaria, etc.</i>) No date can be assigned to the formation of that
deposit, at least from present observation."&mdash;<i>American Naturalist</i>, vol.
II., p. 443.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note B.</span>&mdash;Besides the evidences already enumerated, Col. Charles
Whittlesey gives the following: 1. Three skeletons of Indians in a
shelter cave near Elyria, O., were found four feet below the surface,
resting upon the original floor of the cave, upon which were also charcoal,
ashes, and the remains of existing animals; estimated age, two
thousand years. 2. Several human skeletons were found in a cave near
Louisville, Ky., cemented into a breccia. They were discovered in
constructing the reservoir in 1853. 3. A log, worn by the feet of man,
was found in the muck bed at High Rock Spring, Saratoga, N. Y., at
a depth of nine feet beneath the cave, and estimated by Dr. Henry
McGuire to be 5,470 years old. It was discovered in 1866. 4. Mr.
Koch claims to have found an arrow head fifteen feet below the skeleton
of the <i>Mastodon Ohioensis</i> from the recent alluvium of the Pomme
de Terre River, Mo., and now in the British Museum. His statement
was, however, contradicted by one of the men who assisted him in exhuming
the skeleton. 5. Dr. Holmes, of Charleston, S. C., found pottery
at the base of a peat bog, on the banks of the Ashley River, in
close connection with the remains of the Mastodon and Megatherium.
6. Col. Whittlesey, in 1838, found fire-hearths in the ancient alluvium
of the Ohio, at Portsmouth, O., at a depth of twenty feet, and beneath
the works of the Mound-Builders.&mdash;<i>Col. Whittlesey before the American
Association, in 1868.</i></p></div>

<h3>WRITTEN HISTORY.</h3>


<p>It is not generally known that written history extends so
far back as to make worthless the present system of chronology.
The mighty empires of antiquity must have been a
mystery to many a thoughtful mind. As far back as history
will carry us we not only behold the world teeming with her
millions of people, but also nations rising and empires crumbling.
Rollin felt the difficulties of the chronology which
hampered him. He says the Assyrian empire was founded
by Nimrod eighteen hundred years after the creation of man,
or two hundred and twenty-four years after the Deluge, or
one hundred and twenty-six years before the death of Noah.
Nimrod was succeeded by his son Ninus, who received powerful
succor from the Arabians, and extended his conquests
from Egypt as far as India and Bactriana. Ninus enlarged
his capital to sixty miles in circumference, built the walls
to the height of one hundred feet, and so broad that three
chariots could go abreast upon them with ease, and fortified
and adorned them with one thousand five hundred towers
two hundred feet high. After he had finished this prodigious
work he led against the Bactrians one million seven
hundred thousand foot, two hundred thousand horse, besides
four hundred vessels well equipped and provided. After his
death, Semiramis, his wife, ascended the throne.  She
enlarged her dominions by the conquest of a great part of
Ethiopia. Then she led her army of three million foot and
five hundred thousand horse, besides the camels and chariots
of war, into India, where she suffered a severe defeat. After<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
making these statements, Rollin says, "I must own I am
somewhat puzzled with a difficulty which may be raised
against the extraordinary things related of Ninus and Semiramis,
as they do not seem to agree with the times so near the
Deluge: I mean, such vast armies, such a numerous cavalry,
so many chariots armed with scythes, and such immense
treasures of gold and silver; ... and the magnificence
of the buildings, ascribed to them."<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> The difficulties presented
to the modern historian never would have occurred if
discredit had not been thrown on the writings of the
ancients.</p>

<p><i>Egypt.</i>&mdash;The only history of Egypt, written in Greek, was
that of Manetho, a high-priest of Heliopolis, who lived three
hundred years before Christ. Only fragments of this work
have been preserved. This history is taken from the ancient
Egyptian chronicles, and records a list of thirty dynasties
reigning in one city. His "thirty-one lists contain the
names of one hundred and thirteen kings, who, according to
them, reigned in Egypt during the space of four thousand
four hundred and sixty-five years."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Dr. Buchner says
Manetho "calculates for three hundred and seventy-five
Pharaohs a reigning period of six thousand one hundred and
seventeen years, which together with the present era, makes
about eight thousand three hundred and thirty years."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
Bayard Taylor makes Manetho assign the first dynasty to
about the year 5000 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span><a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Herodotus says the Egyptians "declare that from their
first king (Menes) to this last mentioned monarch (Sethos),
the priest of Vulcan, was a period of three hundred and forty-one
generations; such, at least, they say, was the number both
of their kings and of their high-priests, during this interval.
Now three hundred generations of men make ten thousand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
years, three generations filling up the century; and the
remaining forty-one generations make thirteen hundred and
forty years. Thus the whole number of years is eleven
thousand three hundred and forty." The priests "led me
into the inner sanctuary, which is a spacious chamber, and
showed me a multitude of colossal statues, in wood, which
they counted up, and found to amount to the exact number
they had said; the custom being for every high-priest during
his life-time to set up his statue in the temple. As they
showed me the figures and reckoned them up, they assured
me that each was the son of the one preceding him; and
this they repeated throughout the whole line, beginning with
the representation of the priest last deceased, and continuing
till they had completed the series."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> From the time of
Sethos, the priest of Vulcan, to the burning of the temple of
Delphi, was one hundred and twenty-two years. The temple
was burned <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> 548. The period which, then, has elapsed
from Sethos to the present (1875) is two thousand five
hundred and forty-five years. Adding this to the time of
Menes we have the whole period covering thirteen thousand
eight hundred and eighty-five years. But if the generation
be reduced to twenty years then the period from Menes
to the present is nine thousand three hundred and sixty-five
years.</p>

<p>The recent explorations made by Mariette among the
archives of Egypt have confirmed the testimony of Manetho.
The names of the kings, their order of succession,
and the length of their reigns correspond with Manetho's
table. These discoveries not only testify to the great antiquity
of the empire, but also throw light on the nation,
its manners, and customs. There were found stools, cane-bottomed
chairs, work-boxes, nets, knives, needles, toilet
ornaments, earthenware, seeds, eggs, bread, straw baskets,
a child's plaything, paint boxes, with colors and brushes,
etc., from three thousand to six thousand years old. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
were also found the jewels of Queen Aah-hotep, who lived
1700 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, consisting of exquisite chains, diadems, ear-rings,
and bracelets, which no modern queen would hesitate
to wear.</p>

<p>These statements are still further confirmed by the testimony
of geology. In the year 1850 borings were commenced
in the mud deposit of the Nile. The most important
results were obtained from an excavation and boring made
near the base of the pedestal of the statue of Rameses at Memphis,
the middle of whose reign, according to Lepsius, was 1361
<span class="smcap">B. C.</span> Assuming with Mr. Horner that the lower part of the
platform or foundation was fourteen and three-fourths inches
below the surface of the ground, or alluvial flat, at the time it
was laid, there had been formed between that period and the
year <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1850, or during the space of three thousand two
hundred and eleven years, a deposit of nine feet four inches
round the pedestal, which gives a mean increase of three and
one-half inches in a hundred years. It was further ascertained,
by sinking a shaft near the pedestal, and by boring in
the same place, that below the level of the old plain the
thickness of old Nile mud resting on desert sand amounted
to thirty-two feet; and it was therefore inferred by Mr.
Horner that the lowest layer (in which a fragment of burned
brick was found) was more than thirteen thousand years old,
or was deposited thirteen thousand four hundred and ninety-six
years before the year 1850."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Other excavations were
made on a large scale. In the first sixteen or twenty-four feet
there were dug up jars, vases, pots, a small human figure
in burnt clay, a copper knife, and other articles entire.
When the water soaking through from the Nile hindered the
progress of the workmen, boring was resorted to, and almost
everywhere, and from all depths, even where they sank sixty
feet below the surface, pieces of burned brick and pottery
were extracted.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span><i>Troy.</i>&mdash;Troy, made immortal by the poem of Homer, has
recently been uncovered to the eye of man, and fresh lustre has
been thrown over the ancient bard. The descriptions of Troy
given by Homer, thought to have been a mere work of imagination,
are now shown to be accurate, and also that he must
have been there. For the re-discovery and unearthing of Troy
the world is indebted to Dr. Schlieman. Four buried cities
superimposed one above the other were discovered. The
third city, below the surface, is ancient Troy. The house of
Priam, the Sc&aelig;an gate, the massive walls and pavements, still
remained. In the house of Priam Dr. Schlieman found a
great mass of human bones, among them two entire skeletons
wearing copper helmets, a silver vase, two diadems of golden
scales, a golden coronet, fifty-six golden ear-rings, eight
thousand seven hundred and fifty gold rings, buttons, etc.
Immediately beside the house of Priam, closely packed in a
quadrangular space, surrounded with ashes, and near by a
copper key, were a large oval shield of copper, a copper pot,
a copper tray, a golden flagon, weighing nearly a pound,
several silver vases, a silver bowl, fourteen copper lance-heads,
fourteen copper battle-axes, two large two-edged daggers, a
part of a sword, and some smaller articles. The value, by
weight alone, of all the gold and silver found in or near the
house of Priam, has been estimated at twenty thousand
dollars. During the excavations, over one hundred thousand
articles were found. Every mark showed that Troy had
been suddenly destroyed. Conflagration, ruin, the implements
and the effects of war were visible. Even the brave
warriors who fell while defending the palace of their king
have not yet wholly crumbled into dust.</p>

<p>The four cities may be thus summed up: The topmost
stratum is six and one-half feet in depth and covers the
Grecian settlement which was established about the year
700 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> Beneath the Greek masonry are found the walls
of another city, built of earth and small stones, but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
abundance of wood-ashes shows that the city&mdash;or the successive
cities&mdash;was chiefly built of wood.</p>

<p>The ruins of Troy, next in succession, are from twenty-three
and one-half to thirty-three and one-half feet from the
surface, and form a stratum averaging ten feet in thickness.
Troy is supposed to have been founded about <span class="smcap">1400 B. C.</span>,
and its fall and destruction by fire to have occurred about
1100 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span></p>

<p>Under Troy there is a fourth stratum of ruins, varying
from thirteen to twenty feet in depth. The most remarkable
feature of these oldest ruins is the superiority of the terracotta
articles. These vases are of a shining black, red, or
brown color, with ornamental patterns, first cut into the
pottery, and then filled with a white substance. The age of
these ruins "is a matter of pure conjecture, since the vicissitudes
of the city's history&mdash;frequent destruction and rebuilding&mdash;would
have the same practical effect, or very nearly so,
as a long interval of time. We have anywhere from two to
five thousand years before Christ as the date of the foundation
of the <i>first</i> Troy."<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p><i>Chaldea.</i>&mdash;Berosus, a Chaldean priest of Belus, nearly
three hundred years before Christ, wrote in Greek a regular
history of Chaldea, in nine books. The materials for this work
were supplied by the archives then existing in the Temple of
Belus at Babylon. The work was particularly devoted to a history
of the kingdom prior to the beginning of the Assyrian
empire. Fragments of this work have been preserved by
Josephus and Eusebius. After describing the cyclical ages of
ten fabulous kings, he then comes to what he considers true
history, and enumerates one hundred and sixty-three kings
of Chaldea, who reigned successively from the time when the
list begins to the rise of the Assyrian empire, about the year
1237 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> Berosus begins with a dynasty of eighty-six kings,
and gives their names, which are now lost. He had no chro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>nology
of their time, but subjected it to a cyclical calculation.
His list, which has so far escaped the lapse of time and the
change of hands, is thus preserved:</p>

<p>First, eighty-six Chaldean kings; history and time
mythical.</p>

<p>Second, eight Median kings; during two hundred and
twenty-four years.</p>

<p>Third, eleven kings.</p>

<p>Fourth, forty-nine Chaldean kings.</p>

<p>Fifth, nine Arabian kings; during two hundred and
forty-five years.</p>

<p>The rulers of the Assyrian empire were next added, as a
sixth dynasty. The blank spaces in the list are doubtless
the result of careless copying, or caused by imperfections in
the manuscripts. In order to make the old kingdom of
Chaldea begin about the year 2234 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> the first eighty-six
kings of Berosus have been struck out as fabulous, and the
Median dynasty regarded as spurious, and this without any
show of reason, save that it does not agree with the chronology
which the mutilators of history accept.</p>

<p>Investigations which have been made among the ruined
cities of Chaldea have given great weight to the authority of
Berosus, and are tending to the confirmation of his history.
In Susiana there was found a Cushite inscription, mentioned
by Rawlinson, in which there is a date that goes back nearly to
the year 3200 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> The testimony of the records disentombed
from the ruins, as well as Berosus, contradicts the prevalent
hypothesis that the Magian or Aryan race occupied the
country before the Cushites. These ruins also "confirm
Berosus by showing that Chaldea was a cultivated and flourishing
nation, governed by kings, long previous to the time
when the city known to us as Babylon rose to eminence and
became the seat of empire. During that long time there
were several great political epochs in the history of the
country, representing important dynastic changes, and several
transfers of the seat of government from one city to another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>

<p>By this people, the science of astronomy was well understood.
"Callisthenes, who accompanied Alexander to Babylon,
sent to Aristotle from that capital a series of astronomical
observations which he had found preserved there, extending
back to a period of one thousand nine hundred and three
years from Alexander's conquest of the city.... These observations
were recorded in tablets of baked clay.... They
must have extended, according to Simplicius, as far back as
2234 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, and would seem to have been commenced and
carried on for many centuries by the primitive Chaldean
people." A lens of considerable power, used for either magnifying
or condensing the rays of the sun, was found at Babylon,
in a chamber of the ruin called Nimroud.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p><i>China.</i>&mdash;Litse, an eminent Chinese historian, relates that
there were long periods of time when the Chinese kingdom
flourished, the chronology of which is not preserved, although
there is recorded some knowledge of the rulers. One of
these rulers promoted the study of astronomy. Next come
the historical epochs. During the first, astronomy, religion,
and the art of writing were cultivated. This was a great
epoch, and ruled by fifteen successive kings. In the second
epoch, agriculture and medical science were promoted. In
the third, the magnetic needle was discovered, the written
characters improved, civilized life advanced, and a great
revolt suppressed. In the fourth and fifth epochs, the
descendants of the previous ruler reigned. Next came the
period of Yao and Shin. After this the period of the
"Imperial Dynasties," which began with the Emperor Yu,
who lived two thousand two hundred years B. C. The historical
work of Sse-ma-thi-an narrates events chronologically
from the year 2637 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> to 122 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span><a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p><i>Mexico.</i>&mdash;It is known that books or manuscripts were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
abundant among the ancient Mexicans. There were persons
duly appointed to keep a chronicle of the passing events. Las
Casas, who saw the books, says they gave the origin of the
kingdom as well as the founders of the different cities, and
every different thing which transpired that was worthy of
note: such as the history of kings, their modes of election
and succession; their labors, actions, wars, memorable deeds,
good or bad; the heroes of other days, their triumphs and
defeats. These chroniclers calculated the days, months, and
years. Nearly all these books were destroyed at the instigation
of the monks, and by the more ignorant and fanatical
Spanish priests. A vast collection of these old writings
were burned in one conflagration by order of Bishop Zumarraga.
A few of the works, however, escaped, but none of the
great books of annals described by Las Casas.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Thus
Mexico must be left to the arch&aelig;ologist unassisted by written
history.</p>

<h3>LANGUAGE.</h3>


<p>The origin and growth of language evidently afford a
great field for study, in not only tracing the development of
civilization, but also in confirming the testimony of the
ancients and the conclusions of the geologists. If the unity
of language could not be established, there would still be left
a field so great as would not lessen the interest or the importance
of the subject. But a new language cannot be formed.
For the sake of convenience the many varieties of language
have been grouped into three great divisions, <i>i. e.</i>, the Aryan,
the Semitic, and the Turanian. "The English, together
with all the Teutonic languages of the Continent, Celtic,
Slavonic, Greek, Latin with its modern offshoots, such as
French and Italian, Persian, and Sanskrit, are so many
varieties of one common type of speech: that Sanskrit, the
ancient language of the Veda, is no more distinct from the
Greek of Homer, ... or from the Anglo-Saxon of Alfred,
than French is from Italian. All these languages together
form one family, one whole, in which every member shares
certain features in common with all the rest, and is at the
same time distinguished from the rest by certain features
peculiarly its own. The same applies to the Semitic family
which comprises, as its most important members, the Hebrew
of the Old Testament, the Arabic of the Koran, and the
ancient languages on the monuments of Ph&#339;nicia and Carthage,
of Babylon and Assyria. These languages, again,
form a compact family, and differ entirely from the other
family, which we called Aryan or Indo-European. The third<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
group of languages, for we can hardly call it a family, comprises
most of the remaining languages of Asia, and counts
among its principal members the Tungusic, Mongolic,
Turkic, Samoyedic, and Finnic, together with the languages
of Siam, the Malay Islands, Thibet, and Southern India.
Lastly, the Chinese language stands by itself as monosyllabic,
the only remnant of the earliest formation of human speech."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Anterior to these three families there was still another
from which these were derived. It contained the germs of
all the Turanian, as well as the Aryan and Semitic forms of
speech. It belongs to that period in the history of man
when ideas were first clothed in language, and has been
called the Rhematic Period.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>As regards the origin of language, three theories have been
proposed: the Interjectional, the Imitation, and the Root.
The first supposes that the beginnings of human speech were
the cries and sounds which are uttered when a human being
is affected by fear, pain, or joy. The second supposes "that
man, being as yet mute, heard the voices of birds, and dogs,
and cows, the thunder of the clouds, the roaring of the sea,
the rustling of the forest, the murmurs of the brook, and the
whisper of the breeze. He tried to imitate these sounds, and
finding his mimicking cries useful as signs of the objects
from which they proceeded, he followed up the idea and
elaborated language." The third theory, advanced by Max
M&uuml;ller, is that language followed as the outward sign and
realization of that inward faculty which is called the faculty
of abstraction, and the roots, to which language may be
reduced, express a general, not an individual idea.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>There is more or less truth in all these theories. At
the very earliest period man must have possessed some
method of communicating his wants or ideas. The casual
observer has noticed that animals have methods of communi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>cating
with one another. It is not improbable that at the
very earliest period man's only mode was that of cries and
signs. This may have lasted for a very long time. Then the
mimicking commenced. Next, comparison was resorted to
when he had so far advanced as to describe his thoughts
and, finally, from these various beginnings, from necessary
or forced improvement, his ideas were expressed in root
words.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Instead of new languages originating, old languages
change. They are mutable, and from them new dialects are
produced. In the history of man there never has been a
new language, and the languages now spoken are but the
modifications of old ones. The words now used by all people,
however broken up, crushed, or put together, are the same
materials as were used in the beginnings of speech. New
words are but old words; old in their material elements,
though they may be renewed and dressed in various forms.
"The modifiability of the language and its tendency to vary
never cease, so that it would readily run into new dialects and
modes of pronunciation if there were no communication with
the mother country direct or indirect. In this respect its
mutability will resemble that of species, and it can no more
spring up independently in separate districts than species
can, assuming that these last are all of derivative origin."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>There are from four thousand to six thousand living languages.
The number of unspoken languages is not known.
Their growth has required ages, and during their development
many a parent stalk has ceased to exist. The changes
in a language are slowly produced. It requires centuries to
so far leave a language as to need an interpreter in order to
understand it. Some idea of this slow change may be
gained by comparing the writings in the English language of
different periods. In the year 1362 appeared a poem called
"Piers Ploughman's Creed," which begins as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"In a summer season,<br />
When soft was the sun,<br />
I shoop me into shrowds<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a><br />
As I a sheep<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> were;<br />
In habit as an hermit<br />
Unholy of werkes,<br />
Went wide in this world<br />
Wonders to hear;<br />
Ac<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> on a May morwening<br />

Of fairy me thought." Etc.<br />
</p></div>

<p>Written language is more permanent than spoken, but the
process of either is necessarily slow. When it is remembered
that a language has been derived successively through
numerous others, no special limit or time can be given,
although a very long period would be required. The usually
accepted chronology would not allow sufficient time for the
diversity in the Semitic family, to say nothing of the time
required for the development of the three general classes.</p>

<h3>UNITY OF THE HUMAN RACE.</h3>


<p>The theory of the unity of the human race has caused a
clash of opinions among men of science. It has been the
great battle field among anthropologists, ethnologists, geologists,
philologists, and theologists. Men of acknowledged
ability have been arrayed on either side. Among the foremost
in favor of a diversity of origin have been Agassiz, Sir
Roderick I. Murchison, Georges Pouchet, A. R. Wallace, and
Schleicher. But the weight of evidence and authority is
most in favor of the unity of the human race.</p>

<p>The advocates of the theory of the diversity of the origin
of the human race have advanced many objections against
the unity, and produced arguments in favor of their opinions.
These may be summed up under five heads. 1. The anatomical
differences between the different races, and especially
those which distinguish the black and white. 2. The separation
of the races from each other for unknown ages by great
oceans, and by formidable and almost impassable continental
barriers. 3. The disparity in intelligence, and the grades in
civilization. 4. A medium type cannot exist by itself,
except on the condition of being supported by the two
creating types. 5. When two types become united, two
phenomena may arise: <i>a</i>, Either one of them will absorb the
other; or <i>b</i>, They may subsist simultaneously in the midst
of a greater or less number of hybrids.</p>

<p>The following answers may be given to these objections,
or arguments: 1. It is just as reasonable to suppose that
man is affected, as well as the animals, by climate, food, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
peculiar condition. It is well known that animals have
undergone more or less change by their situation or position.
Elephants and rhinoceroses are almost hairless. As certain
extinct species, which formerly lived under an arctic climate,
were covered with hair or long wool, it would appear that
the present species of both genera had lost their hairy
covering by exposure to heat. This is confirmed by the fact
that the elephants of the elevated and cool districts of India
are more hairy than those on the lowlands.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> A wonderful
change is wrought by the influence of climate on turkeys.
In India "it is much degenerated in size, utterly incapable of
rising on the wing, of a black color, and with long pendulous
appendages over the beak, enormously developed." "In the
English climate an individual Porto Santo rabbit recovered
the proper color of its fur in less than four years."<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Observers
are convinced that a damp climate affects the growth
of the hair of cattle. The mountain-breeds always differ
from the lowland breeds; in a mountainous country the
hind limbs would be affected from exercising them more,
which would also affect the pelvis, and, then, from the law
of homologous variation, the front limbs and head would
probably be affected.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> One of the most marked distinctions
in the races of man is that the skull in some is elongated or
dolichocephalic, and in others rounded or brachycephalic.
Mr. Darwin has observed that a change takes place in the
skulls of domestic rabbits; they become elongated, while
those of the wild rabbit are rounded. He took two skulls of
nearly equal breadth, the one from a wild and the other
from a large domestic rabbit, the former was only 3.15, and
the latter 4.3 inches in length. Welcker has observed "that
short men incline more to brachycephaly and tall men to
dolichocephaly; and tall men may be compared with the
larger and longer-bodied rabbits, all of which have elon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>gated
skulls."<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> The argument from language is of great
weight, especially in considering the differences in color.
Professor Max M&uuml;ller has stated this clearly: "There was a
time when the ancestors of the Celts, the Germans, the Slavonians,
the Greeks and Italians, the Persians and Hindus,
were living together beneath the same roof." "The evidence
of language is irrefragable, and it is the only evidence
worth listening to with regard to ante-historical periods. It
would have been next to impossible to discover any traces of
relationship between the swarthy natives of India and their
conquerors, whether Alexander or Clive, but for the testimony
borne by language."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> When the great lapse of ages is
taken into consideration, since man originated, it will be
seen that sufficient time is given to produce the white, black,
yellow, red, and brown varieties of man.</p>

<p>2. The argument from geographical distribution would
hardly seem valid, as it is known that the ocean can be and
has been navigated by frail crafts. Lieutenant Bligh, of the
ship Bounty, in a small boat, twenty-three feet long from stem
to stern, deep laden with nineteen men and one hundred and
fifty pounds of bread, twenty-eight gallons of water, twenty
pounds of pork, etc., started from the island of Tofoa (South
Pacific) for the island of Timor, a distance of three thousand
six hundred miles. In this voyage he encountered a boisterous
sea, and great perils, but finally reached his destination.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
When men began to dwell on the sea-coast they made their
small vessels and carried on a limited navigation. Many a
frail craft has been driven out to sea with its human freight,
some of which landed on uninhabited islands. This has often
happened among the South Sea islanders.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> If it had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
asserted, a few years ago, that man's distribution might have
been partly caused by the agency of ice, it would have
received no attention. And yet, Captain Tyson and his
party, consisting of twelve men, two women, and five children,
being a portion of the crew of the ill-fated Polaris,
drifted about from the 15th of October, 1872, to the 30th of
April, 1873, on an ice-floe, and in the midst of an arctic
winter. Besides the provisions saved from the Polaris they
subsisted on the flesh of seals, birds, and bears that they
were able to kill. Every member of this party was rescued
off the coast of Labrador. It must be further noticed that
the surface of the earth was not always the same. The
continents have changed more or less, and during these
changes man must have become more or less separated.</p>

<p>3. In respect to the disparity it may be replied that the
two extreme points are observable in all the nations of the
earth. Even in single families there have been those who
were highly cultured and refined, while other members have
been very low in organization, habits, and tastes. In these
days it is manifest that all the races are capable of a very
high degree of improvement. On the other hand, nations
have retrograded. The ignorant, wretched nomads who
pitch their tents amid the ruins of Babylon, are the descendants
of the ancient mixed races who successively occupied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Mesopotamia: the Assyrians, Babylonians, Medes, and Persians,
who were ruled by such renowned monarchs as
Shalmaneser, Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus, and others. The wild
marauding Arabs are the descendants of a people who
invented algebra and introduced the numerals. So the list
might be extended.</p>

<p>4 and 5. The fourth and fifth amount to the assumption
that no race will amalgamate with another. The statements
embraced under these two heads are not warranted by facts.
Dr. Prichard says, "Mankind of all races and varieties are
equally capable of propagating their offspring by intermarriages,
and that such connections are equally prolific whether
contracted between individuals of the same or of the most
dissimilar varieties. If there is any difference, it is probably
in favor of the latter."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> He then gives a short account of
several examples of new or intermediate stocks which have
been produced and multiplied. They are Griquas, descended
from the Dutch and Hottentots, who occupy the banks of
the Orange River, and number five thousand souls; the
Cafusos of Brazil, a mixture of native Americans and African
Negroes; the Papuas of the island of New Guinea, a mixture
between the Malays and Negroes. One of the best
examples yet furnished is that of the Pitcairn Islanders.
This colony originated in this way: The British government
had sent a vessel, called the Bounty, commanded by Lieutenant
Bligh, to gather bread-fruit trees at Otaheite and
introduce them into the West Indies. Bligh was an overbearing,
tyrannical, and cruel officer. Driven to fury, and
out of patience with the superior officer, Mr. Fletcher Christian
and others mutinied, and turned Bligh and his eighteen
companions adrift. The mutineers proceeded to Tahiti; here
they took on board provisions and live stock, nine Tahitian
men, twelve women, and eight boys who had secreted themselves,
and then proceeded to Toubouai, where they founded a
settlement. Owing to dissensions the colony broke up and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
removed to Tahiti. But Mr. Christian, with eight other of
the mutineers, three Toubouaians, three Tahitian men with
their wives, and one child, and nine other women, left in the
Bounty and landed at Pitcairn's Island, and there burned the
Bounty on the 23d of January, 1790. In less than nine
years afterward, owing to strifes, the men were reduced to
two in number, both whites, and one of them died the succeeding
year. In the year 1808 the American ship Topaz
touched at the island. The colonists then numbered thirty-five.
In 1856 they had increased to the number of one
hundred and ninety, and as the produce of the island was
barely sufficient to support them they were removed by the
British government to Norfolk Island. There are only
eight surnames among them&mdash;five of the Bounty stock and
three new-comers. They are a fine, healthy race of people;
the men of a bright copper color, but the women are scarcely
distinguishable from English women. If reports be true
concerning them, they are the most remarkable people on
earth. They never allow the sun to go down on their wrath,
and are noted for their honesty, truth, chastity, industry,
benevolence, reverence, simplicity, and all the virtues which
combine to form true religion.</p>

<p>The law of hybridity, which has been so strongly urged
against the unity of the race, has proved an argument in
favor. The offspring of birds as much alike as the domestic
goose and the large Muscovy duck will not propagate their
species. Mules cannot perpetuate their kind. The different
varieties of the horse, such as the little black Shetland
pony and the tall white Arabian, will not only breed together
but these hybrids will continue to perpetuate their kind,
thereby proving their identity of species. The same may be
said of the cross between the most perfect and the lowest
type of mankind. If some of these mixtures die out in a few
generations, it is not owing to their hybridity, but to the plain
violation of natural laws. When the contracting parties to
a marriage are of the same constitution, there will be no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
issue; if the constitutions, or rather, temperaments, are in
substance too nearly the same, the issue, if any, will be either
still-born, or die very soon after birth; if the contracting
parties shall have an adjunctive element, the issue will be
short-lived, although they may arrive at the years of maturity.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
These laws apply to both the mixed and the unmixed
types of mankind.</p>

<p>The close affinity of all the races, their subjection to the
same general laws, their capacity for mental and moral
improvement, and the virtual unity of their languages lead
to the conclusion that one birth-place was common to
all. If that place be Central Asia, or any other locality, it
must have been long before traditional times, when the one
tribe was broken up and nations formed.</p>

<p>Races change so slow that they seem to be stationary.
On the ancient Egyptian monuments are representations of
the Negro, having exactly the same features which characterize
that race at the present time; and some of these paintings
date as far back as 2000 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span></p>

<p>Then from the unity of the race and the persistency in
type, an almost incredible length of time must be assigned to
permit of the great disparity as exhibited by the different
types of mankind.</p>

<h3>THE BIBLE AND SCIENCE.</h3>


<p>No book has caused so much controversy as the Bible.
It has been made to answer for the folly of both its friends
and foes. The fierce assaults made by the sceptic have been
the legitimate result of the preposterous claims made by
its ignorant but too zealous friends. The Bible makes no
such claims for itself as have often been made for it. Its
meaning has been perverted, sentences distorted, and words
changed in order to suit the caprice of its advocates. If it
were a living, speaking existence, it would certainly beg to be
delivered from its friends. It has been made to conflict with
the investigations of science, and those engaged in interpreting
the laws of nature have been branded as infidels,
although they may have devout and reverent spirits. The
Bible is not and makes no pretensions of being a book of
science. It is designed to be a book of religion, and a history
of the ancient Jews, and its references to scientific questions
are only incidental. If the references to science, or the
account of Creation be radically wrong, its teachings on
questions of morals and religion would not be thereby invalidated.
The Christian, or the Jew, has nothing to fear from
the results of scientific investigation. But there is a duty
devolving on him, and that is to leave his fanciful interpretations
and come to the true meaning of the Scriptures, and
there learn how the words were understood by those to whom
they were originally addressed. The meaning of words, as
used in the nineteenth century, is not to be connected with
their signification as used in the past. There is a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
distance that divides the present from the times of the
Hebrews, and their language and thoughts from the English
language and modern thought. The ancient Hebrews were
not given to scientific pursuits, and could have been but
comparatively little advanced in civilization.</p>

<p>It is not the design here to enter upon an investigation of
the points raised between the Scriptures and science, but to
confine the inquiry to such questions as the previous chapters
have demanded.</p>

<p><i>Creation.</i>&mdash;The first and second chapters of Genesis not
only teach that God is the Creator of heaven and earth, but
also the order of succession is given. It is not stated that
the world was created out of nothing. The word "bara,"
translated "created," has a variety of meanings. According
to Gesenius it means <i>to cut</i>, <i>to cut out</i>, <i>to carve</i>, <i>to form</i>, <i>to
create</i>, <i>to produce</i>, <i>to beget</i>, <i>to bring forth</i>, <i>to feed</i>, <i>to eat</i>, <i>to
grow fat</i>, <i>to fashion</i>, <i>to make</i>.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The idea presented seems to
be this: The author asserts that heaven and earth owe their
origin to God. Then he goes back and explains the successive
stages of creation. At the commencement of the work
the earth was formless and void, or in a nebulous condition,
and from this pre&euml;xisting mass the worlds were evolved.
When this mass was created, if ever, the author of Genesis
does not state.</p>

<p>Six periods, or "days," are given for the formation of the
earth. The use of the words "evening and morning" naturally
leads to the conclusion that the <i>days</i> were each twenty-four
hours in length. But doubt is thrown over this
conclusion by the use of the word <i>day</i> in the second chapter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
and fourth verse, where the whole creative week is called
a <i>day</i>. The word translated "day" also means <i>time</i>, but it
is to be generally taken in the sense of the civil day&mdash;from
sun up to sun down. Hugh Miller held to the opinion that
the creation was represented to Moses in a vision. The
periods passed before his mind in succession and had the
appearance of days. The evening was the closing of one and
the morning was the beginning of another period of time.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
If a description of the different orders of life had been given,
it would have been beyond the comprehension of that primitive
people. It was not the design to teach geology. The
people were not prepared for such scientific knowledge. But
the simple statement that God is the author of all things,
could be and was understood by the Israelites.</p>

<p>On the sixth day man appears; but there are two records,
and in them he is presented in different ways and for different
purposes. In the first account man is made in the image
of God, and to him is given dominion over the living things,
and he is commanded to subdue the earth. The second
account states that there was no man to till the ground, and
the Lord formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man
became a living soul. The second account cannot be, as
has been assumed, a repetition of the first. The two
accounts are radically different. One account makes man to
have dominion over the beasts, birds, and fishes; the other,
to till or cultivate the soil. This agrees with arch&aelig;o-geology.
Men were hunters many ages before they were agriculturists.
The one account has man made in the image of God, the
other, a <i>living soul</i>. The "image of God" and "living soul"
may be the same, but why the change? There may be a
cause for it. If the theory of the vision be the true one,
then Moses saw man in two capacities, differing one from the
other. Man may be in the "image of God," and yet in a
low, savage condition&mdash;subsisting on the chase. Man may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
be awakened from that condition, the "image of God" may
assert its majesty, and make man a religious, worshipful
being.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> That there were two classes the record implies.
Cain goes out into the Land of Nod, where his wife
conceives, and he builds a city. Where did Cain get his
wife, and why did he build a city? No account is given of
the birth of his wife, but the natural inference is he obtained
her in the Land of Nod.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> It has been contended that Cain
married his sister. If this be true it would certainly have
been mentioned. It is too important a matter to have
escaped notice. If he married his sister he was guilty of a
heinous crime. If it was right then, it is right now. The
city he built must have been more than an <i>encampment</i>, or a
<i>small fortification</i>. (The word translated "city" bears this
meaning also.) It would have been of no moment. It must
have been a place of some consequence, and designed for
more persons than Cain, his wife, and son. Taking all the
circumstances together, including Cain's dread "of every one
that findeth me shall slay me," it would seem that the object
of this city was to provide for individuals of the pre-Adamic
family dwelling on the east of Eden, and possibly to ingratiate
himself into their favor.</p>

<p>Then, again, in the sixth chapter, "The sons of God saw
the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took
them wives of all which they chose." This was followed by
great wickedness, in consequence of which the world was
destroyed by a flood. Who were the "sons of God," and
who the "daughters of men"? Why not the daughters of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
God? The "sons of God" must have been the lineal descendants
of Adam, and the "daughters of men" the offspring
of the pre-Adamic race. The mongrel race produced
were monsters,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> and their minds were bent continually on
doing evil. These sons of Adam must have retrograded, or
else they would not have sought wives from among a lower
people. By the laws of nature their offspring was lower
than either of the races, from the fact that to the brutish
natures of the pre-Adamic type would be added the natural
wisdom of the Adamic, thus producing cunning and craft in
their wickedness.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> If stringent moral laws had been
enforced upon them the result would have been reversed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Chronology.</i>&mdash;The chronology given in the margins of the
Bible is a mere invention, and has worked much mischief.
There is nothing to warrant it, and no excuse can be made
for it. The Bible gives no definite chronology for those
early times. That no dependence can be placed in these
chronologies is shown from the discrepancies between the
Septuagint and the Hebrew texts.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> The Septuagint dates
the Flood eight hundred years farther back than the common
Bible. "A margin of variation amounting to eight centuries
between two versions of the same document, is a variation
so enormous that it seems to cast complete doubt on the
whole system of interpretation on which such computations
of time are based."<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p><i>The Deluge.</i>&mdash;Allowing the date of the Deluge to have
been 3149 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> instead of 2349 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, still there is not sufficient
time to repopulate the earth, and form those mighty empires
recorded in ancient history. The Duke of Argyle has very
justly remarked that, "The founding of a monarchy is not
the beginning of a race. The people among whom such monarchies
arose must have grown and gathered during many
generations." The peopling of Egypt is not the only difficulty.
"The existence, in the days of Abraham, of such an organized
government as that of Chedorlaomer shows that two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
thousand years <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> there nourished in Elam, beyond Mesopotamia,
a nation which even now would be ranked among
'the Great Powers.'"<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Then the characteristic features of
the Negro, one of the most strongly marked among the varieties
of man, were as greatly marked 2000 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> as at present.</p>

<p>These statements lead to the conclusion that the Flood
was not universal. Most nations have a tradition of a flood,
but "the monuments of the two most ancient civilizations of
which we have any knowledge&mdash;the Egyptian and Chinese&mdash;contain
no account of, or allusion to, Noah's Deluge."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
Many of these traditions doubtless refer to some local flood.
The passages of Scripture seem to teach the universality of
the Deluge, but the same expressions which convey the idea
of universality, are sometimes used in a limited sense, and
refer only to the Holy Land, and to bordering regions. The
question is one of doubt whether or not the sacred historian
means the Noachian Deluge to have been universal, or only
a local cataclysm.</p>

<p><i>Monarchies.</i>&mdash;The Scriptures do not state that Nimrod
was the first monarch, but "the beginning of his kingdom
was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh." Nor is the
statement made that he founded these cities. He was a
mighty hunter, and these cities were the <i>beginning of his
kingdom</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Dispersion.</i>&mdash;The building of the tower of Babel is
no myth, but a veritable reality. A portion of the mighty
fabric still stands, a mountain of ruins, attesting to the vast
amount of work it required in its construction. The story is
told in few words, and those words cover centuries. The
people engaged in its construction spoke one language, but
when this language was confounded the empire was rent
asunder. The narrative seems to teach the use of but one
language on the whole face of the earth. Dr. F. H. Hedge,
in his sermon on "the Great Dispersion," says, "Moreover,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the phrase 'the whole earth,' as commonly used in the Bible,
is not to be taken in an absolute or scientific sense. It is not
intended to include the entire globe, or even the greater
part thereof, but is loosely employed to designate the whole
of that particular portion which the writer or speaker has in
his mind at the time. In the present case it denotes the
country bordering on the Tigris and the Euphrates."<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> If
the views of this eminent theologian be correct, then, by the
same principle of interpretation the unity of language
spoken of, is limited to the country bordering on the
Tigris and the Euphrates.</p>

<p>There is no necessity of a supernatural aid for the origination
of language. Under the view already advanced, when
the animals were brought to Adam, he readily gave them
names, for he had received language from his predecessors,
and now, being an especially chosen person, his endowments
would lead him to a more vigorous application of its use.</p>

<p>It is not incredible that God could have fashioned the
world and peopled it with myriads of beings in a period of
six days of twenty-four hours each. It is not incredible that
a cataclysm could destroy every living creature, save an appointed
few, and cover the remotest boundaries of the earth.
It is possible for God to do anything save that which is
inconsistent with his character. What is possible for God to
do, and what He does, are two very different things. What
He has done can only be told from the evidences which He
has left. What He might have done is only speculation.
Man can only judge from the facts presented to him. He
observes the course of nature, and from these observations
his conclusions are drawn.</p>

<p>The world of nature and the spirit of revelation, when
properly understood, are seen to be in harmony. Man is not
to close his eyes and refuse to be guided by science, and
with blind credulity accept the tales and prejudices of his
grandfathers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Dean Stanley, an eminent divine of the Church of England,
in his discourse at the funeral of Sir Charles Lyell, takes unusual
grounds for a theologist. He is reported as saying that there were and
are two modes of reconciling the letter of Scripture with geology, but
each has totally and deservedly failed. One of these attempts to wrest
the words of the Bible from their real meaning, and force them to
speak the language of science; the other attempts to falsify science to
meet the supposed requirements of the Bible. But there is another
reconciliation of a higher kind, or rather an acknowledgment of the
affinity and identity which exist between the spirit of science and the
spirit of the Bible. First, there is a likeness of the general spirit of
the Bible truths; and, secondly, there is a likeness in the methods.
The frame of this earth was gradually brought into its present condition
by the slow and silent action of the same causes which we see now
operating through a long succession of ages beyond the memory and
imagination of man. We do not expect this doctrine to agree with the
letter of the Bible. The early biblical records could not be literal,
prosaic, matter-of-fact descriptions of the beginning of the world. It
is now clear that the first and second chapters of Genesis contain two
narratives of the Creation side by side, differing from each other in
almost every particular of time and place and order. It is now known
that the vast epochs demanded by scientific observation are incompatible
both with the six thousand years of the Mosaic chronology and the
six days of the Mosaic Creation. The discoveries of geology are found
to fill up the old religious truths with a new life, and to derive from
them in turn a hallowing glory.</p></div>

Mr. Croll believes that, owing to variations in the eccentricity of the
earth's orbit "cold periods regularly recur every ten or fifteen thousand
years; but that at much longer intervals the cold, owing to
certain contingencies, is extremely severe, and lasts for a great length
of time; and the last great glacial period occurred about two hundred
and forty thousand years ago, and endured with slight alterations of
climate for about one hundred and sixty thousand years."&mdash;Darwin's
<i>Origin of Species</i>, p. 343.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> It would be plausible to assume that the ice melted much more
rapidly than is generally supposed. Charles Darwin, in his "Naturalist's
Voyage around the World," p. 245, states that "during one
very dry and long summer, all the snow disappeared from Aconcagua,
although it attains the prodigious height of twenty-three thousand
feet. It is probable that much of the snow at these great heights is
evaporated, rather than thawed."</p></div>

Having seen the statement in one of the newspapers that this
skull was not genuine, but a joke played on Professor Whitney, I wrote
to Professor W. Denton of Wellesley, Masschussetts, on 19th March
1875, inquiring about it. A few days later I received from him the
statement that he had visited the place where the skull was found;
that certain persons assured him that Professor Whitney had been the
victim of a joke. Yet these persons had never seen the skull, and were
prejudiced against Professor Whitney. The persons who were best
informed had every reason to believe the statements made by Professor
Whitney were true. The skull is a very remarkable one, and
stands alone for the enormous size of the orbits, and I have good reasons
to believe it to have been found as stated.</p></div>

of Otaheite, who had been drifted thither in a canoe, although the distance
between the two isles is five hundred and fifty miles. In 1696,
two canoes, containing thirty persons, who had left Ancorso, were
thrown by contrary winds and storms on the Island of Samar, one of
the Philippines, at a distance of eight hundred miles. In 1721, two
canoes, one of which contained twenty-four, and the other six persons,
men, women, and children, were drifted from an island called Farroilep
to the island of Guaham, one of the Marians, a distance of two
hundred miles." Kadu, a native of Ulea, and three of his countrymen,
while sailing in a boat, were driven out to sea by a violent storm,
and drifted about the sea for eight months, subsisting entirely on
the produce of the sea, and finally were picked up in an insensible
condition by the inhabitants of Aur (Caroline Isles) one thousand
five hundred miles distant from his native isle.&mdash;<i>Principles of Geology</i>,

invention, and most likely called forth by the contact between Jews

this notion that the Jews first asserted that God made all things out of
nothing. The word, however, only calls forth the simple conception
of <i>fashioning</i> or <i>arranging</i>.&mdash;<i>Chips</i>, vol. i. p. 132.</p></div>

appears to have been a familiar name at the time of the fratricide. It

been roving tribes there, and from them the place was designated
"Wandering Land"?</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_125_125" id="Footnote_125_125"></a><a href="#FNanchor_125_125"><span class="label">[125]</span></a> Dr. Livingstone, after speaking of a half-caste man on the Zambesi,
described by the Portuguese as a rare monster of humanity,
"remarks, 'It is unaccountable why half-castes, such as he, are so
much more cruel than the Portuguese, but such is undoubtedly the
case.' An inhabitant remarked to Livingstone, 'God made white men,
and God made black men, but the devil made half castes.' When two
races, both low in the scale, are crossed, the progeny seem to be eminently
bad. Thus the noble-hearted Humboldt speaks in strong terms
of the bad and savage disposition of Zambos, or half-castes between
Indians and Negroes; and this conclusion has been arrived at by
various observers. From these facts we may perhaps infer that the
degraded state of so many half-castes is in part due to reversion to a
primitive and savage condition, as well as to the unfavorable moral
conditions under which they generally exist."&mdash;<i>Animals and Plants
under Domestication</i>, vol. ii. p. 63.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_126_126" id="Footnote_126_126"></a><a href="#FNanchor_126_126"><span class="label">[126]</span></a> This view does not conflict with the doctrine of the unity of the
race. The great difficulty in interpreting the Scriptures is its briefness.
A long period of time is comprehended in a very few words,
and much is left to inference. The tenor of the Scriptures favors the
idea of the unity of the race, still it is not specifically declared. The
strongest passage is Acts chapter 17 and verse 26: "Hath made of one
blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth."
This does not conflict with the idea of there being more than one pair,
but their <i>blood</i> is the same. It is not declared that Adam had no ancestors.
When it is declared that Adam was the son of God, it is only
to trace man's origin to the Supreme Being. If Adam had ancestors,
the leaving of them out has no signification, as it was not
uncommon to drop the name of unimportant persons. An instance of this kind is
given in the genealogy of David. From the birth of Obed to the birth of
his grandson David (common chronology) is a period of two hundred
and twenty-three years. Evidently one or more members have been
dropped. If Adam was a prototype it was not necessary to trace the
line any farther back. The forming him of the dust of the ground
would give his relationship to the rest of mankind. He was chosen,
endowed for the purpose of elevating the race&mdash;of becoming the head
of a new type of humanity.</p></div>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
